                            “I was talking to one of my friends yesterday, and he told me that he feels sorry for international students who have to celebrate their holidays alone, away from family and home. It reminds me of something that I think I’ve told you before – I really admire international students for what I believe takes a ton of bravery, to move to a strange new place far away from what is familiar and comfortable, to a place where the language and culture is often different, to a place that they’d often never set foot in before. I remember when I was about to start my first year of university, and I was moving literally 40 minutes away from my parents’ house, and I was already nervous and anxious, even though in all honesty I had no reason to be. My roommate in first year was an international student from Taiwan, and one night I asked her why she had chosen to study at UBC. She replied, "I want to broaden my horizons and challenge myself.” <br><br> Somehow it turned out that I would find myself in a peculiar sort of parallel situation, where instead of my moving halfway across the world away from my parents, they’d move halfway across the world away from me. People are always confused when I have to explain that I’m Canadian and I’ve grown up in Canada almost all my life, but my parents currently live in Shanghai. One of the questions I dislike the most on forms and applications is, “What is your permanent address?” because I never know what to write – do I write my UBC residence address, which is hardly permanent, or do I write the address of the home that I grew up in, which is now occupied by a family that I’ve never met, or do I write my parents’ address in Shanghai, which I’ve never lived in long-term?”

Looking back on it, it took them an incredible amount of courage – like they had a comfortable life in China, with a house in the city, well-paying jobs, family nearby, a familiar environment. To completely pack up and set off for a completely unfamiliar country on the other side of the world, where people speak a language foreign to them, and with a three-year-old child in tow… That’s incredible. Immigrant parents are incredible. ”

                        Une petite réflexion dans l’autobus en route de Berlin à Prague
                    </p>
                    <p class = "textss">
                        En achetant mes billets d’avion, je me suis demandée ce qui m’attirait au voyage. Pourquoi passais-je autant de journées que possible en voyageant de pays en pays ? C’est vrai que les images de ces villes m’ont été toujours familières, depuis que j’ai commencé à rêver du voyage. Des grands places dont les bâtiments imposants témoignent des décennies, peut-être des centaines d’années d’histoire. Des rues et des boulevards dont les noms rappellent tant de cours d’histoire et de langues, des chansons et des romans et des films. Des plats locaux qui ne se trouvent pas chez moi. Des gens, les individus qui résident dans ces villes, que je n’aurais jamais rencontrés, dont les vies sont peut-être semblables à la mienne, ou peut-être complètement différentes. 
                        <br><br>
                        Le voyage, c’est la richesse. C’est l’occasion d’explorer, d’apprendre, de se sentir inspiré. Réinventé, peut-être. De se lancer dans l’inconnu, pourtant ce n'est peut-être pas la destination qu’on trouve à la fin, mais soi-même. De voir avec ses propres yeux à ce qui ressemble le monde, de se rendre compte qu'à quel point le monde est énorme, illimité. De se rendre compte, peut-être, qu'à quel point le voyageur est illimité. 
                        <br><br>
                        Après plus de cinq jours de voyage, j’ai découvert cinq raisons pour lesquelles l’envie de voyager est tellement forte. 
                    </p>
                    <p class = "undertitless">
                        Un— Je veux vraiment connaitre un nouveau coin du monde.

                        Si on m’a demandé ce que je savais sur la ville de Copenhague avant que je m'y sois rendue, je n’aurais pu dire que, « C’est la capitale du Danemark. » Mais après les quarante-huit heures que j’ai passé dans cette ville de taille moyenne, Copenhague est devenu beaucoup plus qu’une ville sur la carte du monde accroché au mur dans ma chambre. Je sais maintenant qu’on peut trouver, dans le halle ouest de Torvehallerne, un étal qui vend des smørrebrød qui coutent un peu chers mais qui sont toujours délicieux, un festin pour les yeux autant que pour les papilles. Je sais maintenant qu’à 22h45 dans les jardins de Tivoli commence un spectacle appelé Illuminations, pendant lequel l’eau, la fumée, la lumière et le feu éblouissent l’audience ravi qui se rassemblent à côté du lac. Je sais également qu’il faut s’y rendre au moins cinq minutes à l’avance pour garantir la vue la plus spectaculaire. Enfin, je sais que le magasin Illums Bolighus est sans doute l’un des magasins les plus beaux que j’aie vus dans ma vie, car le magasin n’était pas qu’un magasin, mais c’était un véritable oeuvre d’art.

                        « Ton voyage s’est bien passé ? » me demandera sûrement un ami qui s’attendra à une réponse de « Oui, mon voyage s’est bien passé. » Mais comment pourrais-je résumer des semaines ou bien des mois en une seule phrase ? Une réponse de « oui » ne signifie rien. Mon carnet de voyage sera rempli d’histoires et de photos, de petits moments magiques et de grandes leçons importantes. Le currywurst que j’ai savouré dans un parc berlinois à côté de la rivière pendant un après-midi ensoleillé, après presque une semaine de journées pluvieuses consécutives. Alexanderplatz à Berlin à 21h00, où j’ai regardé flâner et bavarder et rire tous les gens autour de moi pendant que la tour TV surgissait dans le ciel nocturne comme une lune artificielle. J’étais contente, à l’aise, calme. J’aimais l’atmosphère, l'énergie, la musique que jouait quelqu’un avec une guitare, les bruits d’une place pleine de vie. Les lumières de la tour TV, la fontaine. Les gens surtout. Les clients, les couples, les amis, les familles. Les voyageurs, peut-être, des voyageurs comme moi.

                        Pendant mon premier voyage en solo, dans le train à destination de Londres, je me suis trouvée à côté d’un passager britannique qui était en chemin pour rendre visite à sa famille. Nous nous sommes mis à converser et j’ai appris qu’il avait étudié à UCL il y a quelques décennies et que quelques membres de sa famille habitaient à Vancouver, dans un quartier à côté de celui-ci où j’avais grandi. Dans mon auberge de jeunesse à Copenhague, la femme qui dormait dans le lit au-dessous du mien travaillait à Chicago et avait étudié à Barcelone pendant ses études universitaires, et elle avait décidé de passer du temps au Danemark, aux Pays-Bas et en Belgique pour s’échapper de sa vie ordinaire pendant quelques semaines. Dans la croisière du Danemark en Allemagne à 1h00, j’ai appris que l’étudiant qui s’asseyait derrière moi avait grandi dans l’un de mes quartiers préférés à Shanghai, et qu’il souhaitait déménager à Montréal après ses études d'architecture. Je ne sais pas comment s’appelait ces gens, car ils m’ont raconté seulement leurs histoires, mais parfois ce sont les histoires et pas les noms qui restent dans la mémoire.

                        La photographie, c’est un art, malgré les foules de touristes qui s’attroupent devant des monuments pour prendre des photos identiques, avant de monter dans le bus touristique pour visiter le prochain monument. Une bonne photo ne montre pas qu’à quoi ressemble l’objet de la photo, mais elle montre la façon dont le photographe le perçoit. De plus, l’art a toujours fait une grande partie de ma vie. C’est pour cela que j’ai attendu pendant une trentaine de minutes devant la porte Brandenburg le moment parfait où le soleil couchant s’apparait entre les arches de la porte. C’est pour cela que j’ai grimpés les quatre cents marches jusqu’au sommet de l’église de Notre-Sauveur à Copenhague, afin de voir un vue spectaculaire sur toute la ville. C’est pour cela que j’adore les façades colorées de tous les bâtiments dans la capitale danoise, parce que je connais très peu de villes qui appartiennent aussi sûrement au monde des contes de fées.

                        C’est probablement vrai que l’idée de courir des dizaines de kilomètres dans des villes munies de transports publics de haute qualité est un peu folle. Mais je ne veux pas me rendre simplement d’une destination A jusqu’à une destination B, parce que les découvertes les plus mémorables se cachent souvent sur le chemin. Sur une rue dans un quartier de Berlin qui apparaissait assez banal sur la carte, j’ai trouvé par hasard la plus jolie libraire dans toute la ville, un petit magasin rempli de plantes en pot, de lumières brillantes et de chansons anglais pop qui vend des lithographies aussi créatives que l’apparence du magasin, et d’innombrables cafés et boulangeries dont les viennoiseries et les petits gâteaux m’ont fait oublier que je venais juste d’acheter mon déjeuner. 
                        <br><br>
                        Dans l’autobus à destination de Prague, j’ai hâte de découvrir les surprises que la ville me révélera. Malgré le sommeil qui me manque, la lourdeur de mon sac à dos et l’épuisement qui se répand dans mon corps après avoir marché plus de quarante kilomètres pendant une seule journée, l’appel de voyage est toujours plus fort.

                    <p class = "textss">
                        Last night in Prague, flight back to Edinburgh tomorrow. I’m back in the old town square, where I caught my first glance of Prague two days ago. 11pm, Friday night, the square is full of life. The cathedral looms in the darkness, the astronomical tower stands facing it. 
                        <br><br>
                        An hour before midnight, and it’s still warm. I won’t be able to wear a t-shirt outside like this for another month. A slight breeze passes through the air. Cars in the distance, but people and conversation all around me. Couples, friends, families, tourists welding large, bulky cameras. Children with ice cream, authentic Italian gelato, according to the hand-painted wooden sign dangling from one of the street stalls. 
                        <br><br>
                        Prague is a fairytale city, they say. Magical. Charmingly winding streets. Dreamy bridges over the river. Large swathes of green space. An old town that has been immortalized in postcards, photos, paintings. 
                        <br><br>
                        I stand up to leave; I can’t stay too long tonight. Thanks for everything, Prague, thanks for being magical.

                        Noon. Burning summer heat, even if it’s just a fine spring day. I should enjoy this summer weather, given that it’s going to be cold and rainy when I return to Edinburgh. A long market, full of stalls. Mostly souvenirs, but a couple of them sell food too. One of them sells poppy seed and apple strudel. I picked poppy seed.
                        <br><br>
                        It reminds me of the poppy seed cake from LING327, the one Neda baked for us at the end of the term. Stuffed with poppy seeds and a sugary paste, powdered sugar dusted on top. 
                        <br><br>
                        A man in a blue t-shirt sits down on the bench next to me. He’s bought poppy seed strudel from the same vendor. Smiles at me, says something in Czech, points to the cake. Perhaps he’s commenting on how I’m eating my strudel with a plastic fork — a weird Chinese habit, i suppose. 
                        <br><br>
                        We eat together on the beach in silence, enjoying the sunshine. He finishes his in three large bites, stands up, continues to walk down the street.
