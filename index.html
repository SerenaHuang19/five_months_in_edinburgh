We spent the rest of the wait chatting and getting to know each other, and she gave me plentiful tips and advice for my exchange semester. Once we arrived in Edinburgh, we took a taxi into the city together, where she pointed out notable buildings and important landmarks, and finally asked the taxi driver to drop me off first. </span></div>

He was from Pakistan and studied Chemical Engineering, and his enthusiasm for his field was very nice to see. He asked us where we were from and what we were studying and what goals we had for our exchange semester, and even though ultimately I was still sent somewhere else to finish matriculation, I didn’t mind the time that I spent in the waiting room at all. <br><br>
        
                            It turned out that matriculation actually happened at Old College, which was probably the most iconic view of the University of Edinburgh. Unfortunately, a portion of it was currently covered by construction, which really reminded me of UBC. In any case, the part that wasn’t covered up was really pretty and I snapped a couple photos before heading inside with my passport, and the interior was modern and sleek, a stark contrast to the outside.  </span> </div>

I ended up walking there with Angela, a girl from Deaconess who I learned studied computer science at Princeton University, and although I was soon separated from the rest of the New Arthur Place residents among the loud music, dark room, and energetic Scottish dancing, I managed to meet Angela’s friends, some of which were also from Princeton while others were from her residence. I stayed at the Ceilidh for quite a number of hours — the dances were fun, reminding me of the dances at Chicoutimi, even though this event was much more chaotic and not as organized. We often ended up with random partners, frequently bumped into one another, and at one point I was almost kicked in the face when a very tall guy lifted his very tall girlfriend and her stretched-out legs barely managed to miss my face. <br><br>
        
                            Normal dance music sometimes interspersed the Scottish dances and we escaped to the bar occasionally for some much-needed water, and it was there that we socialized (away from the deafening music) and got to know each other. Along with two other Princeton students, I also met another student from Queen’s — just meeting another Canadian amongst all these Americans immediately gave us a close bond — and two students from Sydney, Australia.  </span></div>

                            I was definitely not ready to get out of bed when my alarm clock went off this morning, and I ended up showing up at the New Arthur Place gate at 9:50am without having eaten any breakfast, which was an excellent start to the day that really reminded me of the time in Québec City when I went on a hike with four hours’ sleep and no food. In any case, we headed off towards Arthur’s Seat, stopping at Deaconess on the way to pick up the residents from that building, and during most of the hike up the mountain, I walked silently and alone, mostly lost in my thoughts while everyone around me chatted and socialized with their friends. <br><br>We had quite a bit of time at the top of Arthur's Seat to look around, absorb the view, and take as many photographs as our freezing hands and the freezing wind allowed us. I ran into one of the guys from Hong Kong that I had met yesterday at the PPLS welcome event and his friends all greeted me in Cantonese, which was slightly awkward as I didn’t know whether I should reply in Mandarin or English. Luckily, the hike back down was slightly easier in terms of the route so we quickly escaped the cold, and as we neared the residences, I listened to the conversations around me as people discussed where they wanted to travel to and what they wanted to see while they were on exchange. </span></div>

Even after half a week, I’m still looking for where I belong, where I can find other CBCs (or ABCs or BBCs, depending on where they’re from) like me.

I barely knew any of the titles for the first round, except for the really famous ones such as Beauty and the Beast or It, although I did quite well for the geography round, providing many of the answers in my group — I immediately thought of Oxford for “What is the only town in the UK whose name starts with an ‘o’?” or Rotterdam for “What is the second most populous city in the Netherlands?” I again knew nothing for the last three rounds, but among the eight of us, we could usually come up with a plausible answer for most of the questions, except for the ones that were extremely British-centric. <br><br>
        
                            It was a fun evening — I got to know some of the people that I hadn’t met yet and chatted a bit with those who I already knew, and there was often laughter and fun socializing around the table when we weren’t busy answering questions. A few of them decided to share two pitchers of apple cider, and I tried a sip from Haley’s cup — this was probably an acquired taste that I had yet to acquire, but I was constantly reminding myself to be willing to try new things. At the end of the night, the hosts read out everyone’s team names — the theme was “2018 Headlines,” so a lot of the names were about Trump; ours was Colonies Return Under British Rule, which was amusing because we were all either American, Canadian, or Australian. </span></div>

I was munching on my dinner during it, making myself spinach-hummus wraps and nibbling on apples and yogurt as well, although it took me much longer than usual to eat, because we we were all laughing so hard.<br><br>
        
                            It was particularly amusing because I was Canadian, Nick was American, and Stephanie was British, and even though we deceptively all spoke English (with another couple of languages for Stephanie and me), there were more than enough differences in our language and culture to entertain us for hours on end. We compared the imperial and metric systems, where Stephanie and I both agreed that our system was much better than the American system, or the side of the road that one drove on, where Nick and I were in agreement. We talked about the ground floor not being the first floor — again, North America differed from Britain — or the water taps. <br><br>
                            
                            At one point, we were talking about the temperature, which was always a fun topic. Stephanie declared that she considered a comfortable temperature anything above ten degrees, and I offered that I preferred temperatures of fifteen degrees and up. “I like seventy-two and up,” Nick added, completely poker-faced, while Stephanie and I burst into laughter. At another point, Nick began, “You know what I hate about this country?” to which Stephanie exclaimed, “Rude!” I suggested, “You know what I’m finding it hard to get used to?” and Stephanie approved, looking pointedly at Nick, “That’s how you start a sentence.”  </span></div>

Our conversation quickly switched into Chinese (much to Weijia’s surprise) and we chatted about our linguistics courses and the professors and the differences between university in Europe and in China. Eventually, the three of us headed out of the building together towards our next destinations, and after parting ways with the Master’s student, Weijia and I continued walking together and chatting about our experiences so far, including how Edinburgh was different from China, how many Americans we were meeting, and how many of the Americans of Asian heritage couldn’t speak their heritage languages anymore.<br><br>
        
                            Soon I parted ways with her, because I wanted to check out the Give It A Go Fair, which was equivalent to UBC’s Club Fair. It was in Potterrow, and I wandered around alone for a bit — I found LangSoc, a couple Engineering-based clubs, and some business-related ones. In The Venue, I found some of the cultural clubs, and I signed up for the Exchange club as well as the International Students’ Centre mailing list, and an interesting-sounding Third Culture Kid Club — technically, I didn’t fit the exact definition of a TCK, but I was often lost enough that I could probably relate to their struggles of belonging and identity.  </span></div>

He encouraged me to pursue what made me happy (I told him about how weird it was that my parents, who both had engineering backgrounds, ended up with an Arts child), although he agreed that programming and coding were just useful skills to have in general, and he maintained that literally anyone could contribute something to artificial intelligence and machine learning, no matter their background, because so many people would be required to work on a project of this scale. Even Philosophy majors had something to contribute, he said as an example, and I immediately burst out, “Ethics!” because that was a huge part of artificial intelligence.<br><br>
        
                            There was barely a pause in our conversation as we chatted about our fields of study and the places in which we had grown up and languages in general and what we aimed to do in the future; by the time our conversation showed any signs of slowing down, it was already almost 5:00pm, the official end of the event. Ashwin ended up having to leave because he had other obligations for the evening, although I hoped that I would see him again soon; I hadn’t had such a satisfying conversation in probably really long, and I was immensely glad for this one.</span></div>

There was some conversation in the bus, although they were conducted in murmured whispers so as to not wake those who were sleeping; I was content to remain in silence, too tired to talk but too stubborn to sleep. Occasionally, the overhead speakers would crackle to life when the tour guide had something to announce — when we passed through Glasgow, our tour guide pointed out some of the buildings that we could see from the highway and told us about a few more that we should see when we properly visited Glasgow, and our bus driver gave his opinion on why people from Glasgow were better than people from Edinburgh.<br><br>
        
                            We also passed Loch Lomond, and as we sped past the icy banks of the famous lake, most of us woke up to stare outside at the white landscape — white sky, white lake, white snow. Our tour guide also played the famous Loch Lomond song, which always reminds me of my high school flute days when I learned this song in one of my flute books, and explained the story behind it. Finally, we arrived at our first stop for the morning, a viewpoint called Rest and Be Thankful. It was freezing and small snowflakes were drifting from the skies as we all hopped out of the bus, and everything around us was white — the snow-covered trees and mountains rather reminded me of Canadian winter scenery.</span></div>

He was extremely nice and friendly, too, with an easy-to-understand English accent; he asked me what I studied, why I had chosen Edinburgh, and what my life back in Canada was like.

Now that it was actually sunny and bright, even the fiercely-blowing wind couldn’t deter us from admiring the gorgeous landscape — the castle, which didn’t seem to bear too much resemblance to the castle in Brave but was pretty nonetheless, stood on a sort of cliff overlooking the ocean, which spread into the distance. We headed down the path towards the castle, although we turned left, towards the War Memorial, for our first stop, anticipating that most people would head straight for the castle as it was the main attraction.<br><br>
        
                            We ended up not making it to the War Memorial because the perfect Instagram spot was located halfway between the War Memorial and the castle, and we carefully made our way through the thick, soft grass until we reached a cliff that overlooked the inlet — on one side we could see the blue sky with wisps of white cloud, a sandy beach far below, and cliffs that stretched out into the sea; on the other side we could see the castle and the sun.  </span></div>

We asked Noah about this, because he was obviously the one with the most experience, and instead of directly answering my question, he said simply, “What do you think they’re like?” <br><br>Nick looked at me pointedly, and I hesitated for a moment before giving a few general comments based on what I had heard and knew — they were loud, full of people and alcohol, and sometimes the guys were uncomfortably grabby. Noah acknowledged most of my answers, although in response to the last point he said that in his fraternity, any guy caught being sexually aggressive would be kicked out of the frat, although he admitted that in other fraternities that might be a larger problem. </span></div>

Stephanie and I ended up staying in the kitchen for a while longer — the French toast was quite good, but I wanted some more food, so we decided to share some kale chips along with the rest of my grapes. <br><br>It was a pleasant night together, as we bonded over food and conversation about everything ranging from our families to American stereotypes to our opinions on cross-cultural relationships. By the time we were both ready to leave the kitchen, even my headache had almost completely disappeared, which I was extremely grateful for. </span></div>

It was very similar to the Beyond the BA events that SALSA held at UBC, although this was an event for the entire PPLS school, which meant that the speakers were graduates from not only Linguistics, but also Psychology, Philosophy, and Cognitive Science. They held jobs ranging from advertising to cybersecurity to consulting, and some of them were from the UK while others were from elsewhere, and each one gave good advice, from staying curious to staying focused and motivated and not feeling alone in our uncertainty. There were no epiphanies on my end, although I did hope for a bit of reassurance. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            Afterwards, we had an hour to just network with the speakers and with the other attendees and nibble on some refreshments that the school had provided, and I managed to chat with one of the speakers who had turned her Cognitive Science degree into an IT job; she talked about gaining experience in technology without having a technical degree and emphasized the application of the skills that we learned in our humanities and social sciences degrees — we studied humanity and how humans functioned and we were used to writing papers and explaining and arguing and defending our position, and these were all important skills to have. </span></div>

The establishment that they were going to was a Thai restaurant just on the other side of the street from the Medical School (sometimes the idea of the campus being in the middle of the city was still a little strange, because I still wasn’t used to being able to so easily access the city from the school), and Weijia commented that the last time that she had been here, it had been extremely crowded.

                            The four of us managed to find a table, and one of the girls wanted a meal all to herself while the remaining three of us decided to share a pad thai. Conversation, as we waited for our food and then ate together, was entirely in Chinese and very fun, ranging from the differences between universities here and in China (when the other two girls heard that Weijia was from Fudan, they were suitably impressed, as I had been when I had first found out) and where we were planning to travel to during our exchange here. I was also asked about growing up in Canada, and why my parents were currently living in Shanghai when I had grown up in Vancouver.

I murmured to the pony that I was with in soft Chinese, and hoped that this pony trekking experience would be more comfortable and relaxed than my last horseback riding experience.

                            I was with a pony named Bailey, and one of the tour guides and I chatted as we headed off, talking about everything from what we studied, to why I had chosen to come to Edinburgh, to what life was like in Canada and what the city of Vancouver was known for. We headed through the Pentlands, trotting occasionally (which wasn’t an entirely comfortable feeling, especially as I bounced up and down on the pony), and I tried to admire the pretty landscape when I wasn’t trying to prevent Bailey from stopping by the side of the trail to nibble on the tall grass.

They ranged from topics such as big data (and the lack of privacy on the internet) to China in the twenty-first century, which offered quite a few thought-provoking ideas on the country’s politics, economy, and future. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            I also stopped by the computing section, where I flipped through some books on machine translation and artificial intelligence, before descending to the lowest floor to find the books that I had actually come for — the travel books, because I wanted to plan for my London trip and dream about the rest of the trips that I was going to take. I found a handbook on solo traveling which I flipped through, reading about safety tips and ways to meet new people when traveling solo and important things to keep in mind — my trip was just going to be a smaller taster of solo traveling, because I wasn’t even leaving the country and I was only going for about five days, although it would be a good lesson in independence, confidence, and, hopefully, self-discovery.  </span> </div>

We chatted about our classes and our assignments as we made our way down the street, and I told him about the Colombian dinner that Stephanie had cooked for us last night, including all the food (and the sangria) that she had made. We talked about what we wanted to cook tonight — I shared with him some of my ideas, and he told me what he wanted to contribute to the dinner. It had been a while since either of us had cooked, but we were both very excited for tonight.

                            It didn’t take long before we reached the Chinese supermarket, and we headed inside to browse around; Ian mostly followed me. I started off with the main dishes, quickly finding bai guo, green onion pancakes, and tangyuan, choosing both sesame and red bean flavours (I actually liked peanut flavour the best, but Noah was allergic to nuts). Ian and I also bought a couple different kinds of drinks, including aloe vera (which I hadn’t had in a while) and three different drinks of his choice, including a mango juice, a Brazilian soft drink that he cheerfully described as “artificial ingredients and chemicals,” and a Korean soybean drink. </span></div>

Some people asked her more questions about her talk, and we chatted about bilingualism outreach, immersion schools (she mentioned Gaelic immersion schools in Scotland while I thought of French immersion schools in Canada), and what kind of research people conducted in this field. Antonella could only stay for ten minutes, so she soon left, but the rest of us stayed for a bit longer, and I got to know Tonje’s friend better — I learned that she was from Innsbruck, Austria, and spoke German and a couple other languages. Along with Tonje, we chatted about travel around Europe (Tonje laughed that she should travel more, because travel around Europe was so convenient, but she often didn’t feel the motivation to leave her city), linguistics in general, and the classes we were taking here.

We had originally come to this pub for their trivia night, but apparently there was a darts tournament occurring tonight that took the place of the weekly trivia night, so we ended up just chatting and drinking together. <br><br>There were two large TV screens on either end of the pub, and they were currently showing a professional darts match, which was almost comical in how serious and professional it was, as huge crowds, cheering wildly and bearing signs and other items to support their favourite players, gathered to watch two, middle-aged-looking men throw darts at a target.

I was grateful towards him, and glad that he was playing such a major role in breaking the stereotypes of frat boys that I had been exposed to throughout my years at university.

Our tour guide, who was very animate and never hesitated to imitate the screams and shrieks with as much passion and fervour as the originals must have, told us all manners of stories, ranging from the witch hunts that went on in Edinburgh (this reminded me vaguely of high school history classes) to cannibal clans to evil fairies to grave robbers. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            Although the stories were interesting (and reminded me of all the reasons why we should be grateful that we didn’t live in the Edinburgh of the past), situations were slightly awkward or uncomfortable at times, because we were always in public and therefore passerby and pedestrians constantly passed our tour group. The most uncomfortable situation occurred under North Bridge when a man attempted to pick a fistfight with our tour guide, and I stepped back just slightly so that I was closer to my friends because this was actually a scary situation, but luckily a couple other men in the tour group stepped forward to diffuse the situation before it could escalate any further. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            The rest of the awkward moments beyond that were of a much tamer nature — at one point, the tour guide was mimicking the screams of a man possessed by the devil during one of his witch hunt stories, and a passerby politely asked him if he was okay and if he needed any help. Our tour guide replied, in a totally calm and normal voice, that he was fine and was just giving a tour, and as soon as the passerby continued on, he resumed screaming about the devil. </span></div>

Tonight, I decided to share one of my stories, because I knew that I would regret it if I didn’t seize this chance, and I was in the middle of a room full of strangers; only Daniel, and now Karis and Aayush, knew who I was. I put my name in the hat, reminded myself that I had used to give speeches all the time at Toastmasters, and when my name was drawn, I took a deep breath and walked up to the stage.

I was surprisingly calm and confident as I spoke — I still tripped over words because it’s impossible not to do so, but I wasn’t as worried or anxious as I had thought I’d be. I talked about Fuzhou, Delta, Shanghai, and Vancouver, and concluded with, “Maybe home isn’t a person, maybe home isn’t a place.

It took me a bit of reorientation before I even found the correct branch, and I stood outside the gate uncertainly for a few moments, because there was a large tour group about to head inside the bank and I wondered why a tour group was visiting a bank, of all places. However, even the building’s exterior and property suggested that this bank was no ordinary bank — aside from the gate and perfectly-kept garden, there was also a large, imposing statue right outside the bank.
                            <br><br>
                            
                            I decided to head inside anyway, and immediately I understood why there had been a tour group — the interior of the building was stunning, and it was by far the prettiest bank that I had ever seen. A banker standing near the entrance asked me if I needed any help, and I replied that I was just admiring the building, an answer that he had probably heard very many times before. I snapped a couple pictures and read an information panel displayed in the middle of the bank about the history of the Royal Bank of Scotland and of the building itself.  </span></div>

Then, I headed down a long series of stairs to the building in which the Bookmarket was happening today — it was a bookmaking and art fair, and sounded like something that Selina would really like. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            I spent a while wandering around the two floors of the Bookmarket. There were some cute books, ranging from inspirational books with quotes on chasing happiness and love, to books filled with pictures of photogenic cats. Most of the Bookmarket was filled with stalls by various artists sharing their work — there were prints, photographs, small bound notebooks and sketchbooks, and all sorts of paper art that reminded me of the crafts that I had liked to do when I was in elementary school and high school.   </span></div>

We walked across the grass — I admired the scenery and the broad expanse of the course and Nick admired the actual course — and visited the small bridge that was apparently a huge tourist attraction, and took pictures of each other with the bridge while Nick also met some people who were actually playing golf here. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            Afterwards, we headed back in the direction of the city, since our parking was going to expire soon. We stopped in a cafe called Taste for lunch, where we both bought paninis; it was very welcome to have actual warm food after having spent the earlier part of the afternoon outdoors. For the rest of the afternoon, because Nick and I wanted to check out different things — he wanted to spend more time at the golf course, while I wanted to finish seeing the university, we split ways; we’d meet up later when it was time to head back to Edinburgh.
                            <br><br>
                            
                            Exploring alone for the rest of the afternoon gave me all the freedom to go where I wanted and to change my route at a moment’s notice, depending on whatever caught my attention. I practically sprinted around to all the university buildings, which were all magnificent and beautiful — in particular, I really liked the music building, from where I could hear someone play piano, and standing alone in the gardens, listening to the beautiful melodies, was an amazing experience. I saw all the buildings that I could see, as I dashed from street to street, trying to cover the three main streets as thoroughly as possible in a Z-like pattern, fascinated and delighted by everything that I saw.

On my way down Princes Street, I passed the National Galleries, and a light and sound display outside of the gallery attracted my attention — strings of lights hanging down from the top of the structure lit up in colours that undulated following the rhythm of the music and sounds that played, and I walked through the exhibit along with a small group of other visitors, enchanted and mesmerized by the lights and sounds. It reminded me of the light-up fountains at Chicoutimi last summer, and of my Alice in Wonderland tunnel in Lyon — I took a few photos and short videos before the show ended and I continued on my way. </span></div>

The entire lower floor of the building was devoted to the interactive spaces, among which we found a demonstration of VR and some edible insects. <br><br>There were four types of edible insects displayed in four bowls, which we were free to try — there were two types of worms, crickets, and grasshoppers. Christoph tried them pretty readily, although I was a bit hesitant to, even though the two volunteers sitting at the table claimed cheerfully that they tasted just like nuts and they were high in protein. <br><br>One of the volunteers even declared that the worms were appetizers, the grasshoppers the main course, and the crickets dessert, because they tasted the best. “It’s a three-course meal!” he exclaimed.</span></div>

Luckily, it wasn’t a far walk, and we appreciated some excellent riverside views during the walk there, including of the various bridges that we crossed and St. Paul’s Cathedral on the other side of the river. We soon arrived at Shakespeare’s Globe, and even though we couldn’t actually go inside, we browsed around the gift shop for a while (there were lots of pretty cards and other souvenirs, including one of a pretty, hand-designed card that read, “Such stuff as dreams are made of”) and then explored the entrance to the theatre. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            Images and a newspaper article describing a Shakespeare festival from a couple years ago decorated the entrance, and I read through the article and looked at the pictures — the festival had involved performing every single one of Shakespeare’s plays with theatre companies from all over the world, where each theatre company would add their own cultural twist to the play and perform it in their native language. It was a pretty amazing idea, and the article described the overwhelming pride, joy, and sense of accomplishment that filled the atmosphere of the Globe during the festival, and I wished that I could actually experience something like that in person.  </span></div>

I began working my way through the first floor, gradually moving upwards — I ventured into the Egyptian collection first, because the Rosetta Stone was the star of the collection, and wandered around the mummies, hieroglyphics, and sphinxes. I was also intrigued by the Asian collections — I had access to much larger collections of similar items when I was in Shanghai, but I was curious to see how a British perspective would portray these items, so I spent some time wandering down the Chinese exhibit (evidently, I wasn’t the only curious one, because there were quite a few other Chinese visitors in the exhibit). The South Asian exhibit was right across from the Chinese exhibit, so I headed there next — South Asian history and culture wasn’t something that I was overly familiar with, but since I had recently gained an interest in its languages, I figured I should familiarize myself with the other aspects of learning about a place. <br><br>
        
                            I didn’t have a particular route that I was following, so I simply walked wherever there was something that seemed cool. I made my way through the Ancient Greece exhibit, remembering my childhood interest in ancient cultures and especially their mythology, but also their history, and then wandered around the Ancient Rome exhibit, reading about the expanse of their empire and the remnants they left behind. I found myself again in the Egypt section, where I took some more photos to send to Vincent and Yu Cen (because she liked archeology and bones), and read about the mummification process. There were more rooms devoted to other ancient civilizations, as well as Europe through the centuries, and there was so much to see that I didn’t have the time to read every information panel that caught my eye or examine every object that beckoned in its display case. </span></div>

It was similar to the British Museum in its collection of objects, and I started in a large hall full of statues and sculptures, gradually making my way around the museum. I checked out the Asian section, just like I had yesterday — the Chinese section was separated from the South Asian section by the Islamic section, which I really liked because Islamic art and Arabic calligraphy were both incredibly beautiful, and I also checked out the Japanese section before making my way to the European areas. <br><br>
                            
                            There were long halls filled with items in gold and silver, and jewelry rooms showing examples of jewelry through time and space — the room was dark, but the sparkling gems and precious stones more than lit up the room. I also liked the modern art and design spaces, which showed how art had a different purpose in the modern day, where it could make a statement or send a message or advance political beliefs, and where WeChat and its stickers, strangely enough, made it as an exhibit. </span></div>

The tour was led by a local student who was born and raised in Oxford, although he had studied elsewhere (I wondered what it was like to grow up in the shadow of these amazing buildings and not actually study here), but he was extremely knowledgeable about the university and life in Oxford. <br><br>
                            
                            He was an excellent speaker, knowledgeable and humourous, and he took us around the campus and the city, introducing us to buildings such as the Radcliffe Camera, the Bodleian Library, the Divinity School, the university church, and the Christ Church Meadow. He pointed out filming locations from Harry Potter, and the doorway that served as the inspiration for the wardrobe that led to Narnia. Throughout the tour, he told us lots of stories and history from both the university and the city, ranging from why the university had been founded here at Oxford, important people who had attended the university, the rivalries between different colleges at the university (and, to a lesser extent, the rivalry between Oxford and Cambridge), and the role of the city of Oxford in the history of Britain.

                            Stephanie's family very warmly welcomed me into their home; Stephanie’s mom hugged me in greeting and her sister accompanied me in the living room as they fed me dinner. Stephanie’s mom made us garlic bread and salad, accompanied by charcuterie and cheese, and I chatted with her sister about everything from school to life in Canada and in Edinburgh to the various animes and mangas that enjoyed. Stephanie’s mom asked me at one point if I could still speak Chinese, since my family immigrated to Canada when I was just three years old, and when I answered yes, she exclaimed to Daniella that I was an example of why it was so important to keep in touch with one’s roots.  </span></div>

I watched, fascinated, as he plucked at the instrument, playing some English pop songs that I half-recognized (there was some Taylor Swift and Jason Mraz) — ukuleles always reminded me of those nights in Chicoutimi, with Rohan or any of the others, where music and gentle singing accompanied us late into the cool, summer night.  </span></div>

Somehow, the conversation topic turned into feminism, and whether the guys were feminists or not, and what the difference was between feminism and humanism, and how they defined both. <br><br> It ended up becoming a talk about equality and equity, and advocating for different genders, sexualities, races, and everything else they could think of. Ian and Noah acknowledged that they were white, straight men in this conversation, but they provided thorough explanations of their views, while Betsy pointed out that no matter how involved they tried to be, they could never truly understand what it was like to be a woman in this society (I thought about how differently Daniel and I had felt about walking alone through London at night, or how surprised some guys were when women told them about their reluctance to be out alone at night).  </span></div>

The first place team actually offered to switch their prize with us, although we just shared our cake with them and two of the British girls asked for free alcohol in return.

It turned out to be a fancy boarding school of sorts — there were children having a snowball fight in the front yard, just behind the gates — and as Tonje and I admired the building, we wondered what it would be like to study in a school like this.

                            Soon, we returned back to our original path and continued towards Dean Village, eventually heading down a series of stairs that led towards the riverwalk. We followed the river, which hadn’t frozen over, into the heart of the village; despite the cold and snow, it was really a beautiful place, and we took lots of photos of the cute houses on either side of the river. Tonje also wanted to find a cafe, so we walked around in search of one, but the only one that was open today was tiny and packed, so we finished our exploration of Dean Village before heading somewhere with slightly more open shops and cafes.  </span> </div>

It was a highly fascinating conversation to listen to, because so much of it wasn't relatable to me — they talked about long hours of compiling code, debugging code, running programs, and the various tasks that they did for their classes. <br><br> I thought about equivalent conversations within linguistics, or whatever we called the linguistics student life (I thought about OT tableaux, trying to memorize the IPA, and getting lost in my brackets when drawing syntax trees online) — computer science wasn’t my life, although I wondered if I would ever want it to be, and the linguistics life was nice but I was constantly panicking about what I was going to do afterwards.  </span> </div>

I asked about everything that I could think of, from noun genders and pluralization to adjective inflections to past participle construction. I made comparisons to German, even though she wasn’t entirely familiar with German grammar. <br><br> My enthusiasm for grammar was probably a little overwhelming — she admitted that she wasn’t used to thinking about her language in this way, since she normally just spoke Norwegian without thinking about every last grammatical and linguistic detail, but she tried to answer my questions as best as she could, and I managed to learn quite a bit.

We all sang an off-key rendition of Happy Birthday before Sid blew out the single candle and used a too-giant knife to cut the tiramisu, but we only had one spoon available so we ended up passing it around, with everyone taking a scoop of the tiramisu before passing the spoon onto the next person — it was probably incredibly unhygienic, but nobody seemed to mind. Sid also opened the bottle of champagne that Ian had brought, and everyone took a sip of that too, passing it around; even I tried some, although I didn’t particularly like the taste. After I had finished my cocktail, I also poured myself a tiny glass of rosé — this was probably the most alcohol I had ever had in one night, even though compared to everyone else it was barely anything (especially because Sid’s friend from HKU exclaimed that it had taken me “two hours” to finish my first cocktail).

                            Around midnight, it was decided that we wanted to go out clubbing. It took us a while before we actually headed out, and some of them were already noticeably drunk, but Hive was just down the street, and I had never gone to this infamous club before. Entry was actually free today, which I was glad for, and everyone except me downed a shot of tequila before heading onto the dance floor. It was incredibly crowded (as usual, I was very aware that many people’s elbows were at my face level), but the six or so of us managed to find a space on the dance floor where we could stand in a tight circle. 
                            <br><br>
                            I didn’t recognize most of the songs, and the flashing lights probably weren’t the best, but I attempted to enjoy myself as much as I could, given how unnatural this environment was for me. There were a couple songs that I recognized, though — All Star was a classic clubbing song, and We Are Young and Drive By were actually among the few English pop songs that regularly appeared on my playlists. When the latter two songs came on, and everyone started belting out the lyrics in a voice that was more shouting than singing, but pouring all their emotion and passion into the song, I could actually kind of see why clubbing was considered fun.

It was raining today, which was unfortunate after the last few days of good weather, but I soon arrived at Teviot, where in the New Amphion there were much fewer people than usual; the Mandarin and French tables were even empty, something that I had never seen before, and I thought about the UBC tandem program and how much I missed it. The only two languages that were available today were German and Spanish, and the German table looked slightly better than the Spanish table, so I joined Oli and another German learner (who had come equipped with a dictionary) at the table. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            Oli’s German was alright, and I could understand when he and the other German speaker talked to each other, although my German was extremely rudimentary and it had been a while since I had last engaged in conversation in German, so my ability to contribute to the conversation was severely limited. We managed to chat a bit, though, where I only half-embarrassed myself with my lack of vocabulary and my constant grammatical mistakes — we talked about where we were from, what we studied, how long we had been learning German or any other languages that we spoke, and if we had ever traveled in Germany before. I mostly listened to the two of them, and tried to remember everything that I had forgotten since my German classes at UBC, and wished that my German was as fluent as my French. </span></div>

Nick asked me if I wanted him to buy anything before he went to the grocery store, even offering me coffee or ingredients for dinner; I declined although it was a very generous offer on his part. I was still in the kitchen when he came back, his backpack filled with groceries, and I enjoyed the delightful scent of coconut oil as he cooked dinner — his trademark “dog food.” Stephanie came to join us too, and somehow conversation between them turned into a talk about the Shrek movie, which led to Stephanie watching it on her laptop, with Nick joining in as he ate his dinner.

                            A bit later on in the night, I had a lengthier-than-usual conversation with Noah when he came in to make his usual pancakes. We chatted about everything from his admiration that I spoke multiple languages (I was flattered, but I was also much less impressive than he thought I was) and how exchange was an eye-opening experience especially in terms of cultural understanding and meeting people that we wouldn’t normally meet — he had never had a roommate like me, and I had never had a roommate like him. I really liked my conversations with Noah, even though he wasn’t as extroverted as some of the others in our friend group — we got along pretty well, I thought, and there was a lot that we could both learn from each other.   </span> </div>

                            Nick was strumming his ukulele in the kitchen when I finally headed inside, and we chatted a bit as I prepared my meal of cereal and soy milk. He soon left, although Noah, followed by his mom, was the next person to enter, and he introduced me as, “His roommate who spoke nine languages,” adding that he often complimented me on that (he and Nick both tended to throw out an arbitrary number each time they stated how many languages I spoke, and all of them were wrong). <br><br> His mom looked at me, finally saying that she spoke only one language, and I didn’t really know how to reply.

                            One talked from the perspective of plant pathology, and discussed GMOs and how to increase the efficiency of farming. The other was a specialist in livestock farming, and he declared that worldwide veganism actually wasn’t the answer.

I also flipped through books pertaining to all the other destinations on my list, ranging from Copenhagen to Berlin to Prague, to the best of Italy and Spain, and to Ireland, Belgium, and the Netherlands, trying to decide where I wanted to go, what I wanted to see, and most importantly, what lessons, experiences, and memories I wanted to gain from such a whirlwind itinerary.  </span></div>

In between vector-space models and normalized dot products, the only thing that I actually understood was the idea of a collocation, and that was from my French classes rather than from my linguistics class, but the professor talked about how to measure and model semantic similarity and what tools were used in the field. This was a very hot topic, she told us, and conferences were always overwhelmed by papers relating to distributional semantics. I continued to wonder what I’d be doing in the future.

We admired the cathedral from the outside — it was quite large and impressive-looking, although for the title of “largest cathedral in northern Europe,” I had imagined that it’d be slightly bigger. Nonetheless, Weijia and I took pictures of the immense cathedral and then headed inside, where we paid nine pounds each for a ticket.

                            After lunch, we wandered down the street, where my attention was caught by a different store every couple minutes. We headed into a teddy bear store, which was filled with amazingly-soft teddy bears of all shapes and sizes, and a couple bakeries that offered a selection of sweet and savoury treats. There was even an outdoor market next to the Shambles, which offered a small selection of items including various fresh fruits and vegetables or colourful articles of clothing.

                            However, one store stood out among all the rest and immediately became my favourite store in York — it was a two-storied German Christmas store, packed full with impossibly cute and intricate Christmas-themed items. Aside from relatively simple items such as ornaments in every colour and design imaginable or little gingerbread men and angels to hang on Christmas trees, there were entire displays of Christmas scenes composed with little wooden figures and painted in vibrant colours, as well as extremely intricate carvings and models of German-style houses, cuckoo clocks, and pine forests with deer roaming among the snow-covered trees. The prices of some of the items exceeded a thousand pounds, which were probably testament to the time and incredible skill that it required to create something of this complexity with precision and imagination, and I almost wished that I had spent more time during my childhood pursuing my love for art.  </span></div>

Entrance was free, and we were handed a map as we entered — the museum was divided into two buildings connected by an underpass, so we started with a large building dedicated to the British Rail services. My attention was immediately captured by maps that showed the rail network across the UK — I recognized cities that I had visited, passed through, or heard of — and colourful posters that advertised the various routes and destinations that the British Rail served. The models and displays of the actual carriages themselves were quite interesting as well, from examples of dining cars to royal carriages (which basically looked like the rooms of a palace on wheels, complete with delicately-crafted dining tables and full-size, plush sofas) to examples of first-class, second-class, and third-class carriages.

As tempting as a hot chocolate was, we wanted an actual dinner, especially because I likely wouldn’t be eating again until tomorrow morning, so we headed to the Italian restaurant across the street, which was located inside a building so fancy that it could have been an art museum, complete with chandeliers, marble Ionian columns, and a fantastically high ceiling.

The view of the lake from above was equally as amazing, and as I continued to climb, the city gradually rose into view as well; Arthur’s Seat, in the distance in the other direction, was still speckled with snow. The ground was muddy, or even icy at times, and I took care to make sure that I wouldn’t slip, but I continued to explore and to climb, in awe of the landscapes around me in a way that I had never really felt before in Edinburgh. Perhaps the weather was working some sort of magic today, but in any case, all my negative emotions from earlier this afternoon had completely dissipated away, and I felt so incredibly grateful to be living in such an amazing city.  </span></div>

Nick was in the kitchen as well, munching on his own food as I made pasta and a stir-fry, and at one point, I asked him, “Should I play some music or do you want to play some music?” <br><br>
                            
                            He gave me a slightly-mischevious look and asked, “There’s a really good band called Flight of the Concords — have you heard of them?”  </span></div>

                            <br><br>
                            The topic was discourse coherence, so the professor began by explaining what discourse referred to, and how modality and temporal references played a role in discourse. She used actual linguistics terms that I recognized a bit too well from my semantics courses, such as scalar implicatures, truth conditions, Gricean maxims, and logical form (I wondered how the computer science students felt), and the word “linguistics” was used a bit more frequently than it tends to be used in this course. <br><br>
                            
                            She finished the class with a couple technical notes about how to model discourse coherence computationally and went slightly overtime, and all she said at the end was a simple, “Good luck on the exam.” Clapping, hesitant at first until more students joined in, finished the course, and I was glad to recognize this tradition of clapping for the professor on the last day of class. </span></div>

Despite the brevity of the ride, we managed to drive through sun, rain, and a strange moment when grey clouds and rain were visible from the left side of the bus, and bright blue sky and warm sunshine were visible from the right side of the bus (Hoji explained that Scotland’s weather contributed to the large number of rainbows that we’d be able to see — we would end up counting more than ten rainbows during the entirety of the two days). <br><br>
        
                            Soon, we arrived at Glen Coe, which was a familiar sight for those who had attended one of the IST trips in February, but was a completely new sight for me, and the landscape was one of the most stunning ones during the entire trip. A dramatic scene of light and shadow, ever-changing as the clouds drifted in and out through the snow-dusted mountain peaks, played out before us, and the mountains seemed to undulate into the distance. A couple moments of sun through the clouds lit up the landscape and sparked another flurry of photo-taking, and I squinted up towards the summits of the mountains, trying to absorb the feeling of standing at the bottom of these mighty giants.  </span></div>

Portree was the largest town on the Isle of Skye, and it was famous for coloured houses and fish and chips, among other things. <br><br>
                            
                            We didn’t have very much time to explore, however, and Hoji advised us to find lunch first before exploring the small town, so he led us to a fish and chips establishment which was probably the lunchtime destination of half the tour bus, although the fish and chips were supposedly extremely fresh and not too expensive (it was cheaper than my lasagna last night, that was for sure). We ate in a small picnic-like area filled with picnic tables just outside of the tiny restaurant as there was no seating space inside, and once most of us had finished our food, we headed out to spend the rest of our time exploring Portree. We headed down to the harbour, where a large number of boats and buoys floated on the water, and admired the blue waters and the coloured houses, and then headed up to look for a tower that promised amazing views over Portree and the water.   </span></div>

They were just fifty-one pounds for a round-trip flight to Italy, which was pretty impressive because most round-trip tickets during this time cost close to a hundred pounds, and I knew that if I waited and watched the price rise, I’d regret not seizing the moment. Still, it was a pretty impulsive decision — probably the most impulsive decision I’ve ever made, at least on this scale — and I quickly booked accommodations and bought my train ticket as well. I’d be arriving in Milan and spending the night in Florence, which was perhaps a slightly unreasonable decision, but I wanted to see more than one city and the accommodations in Florence were cheaper. The website for the train tickets was in Italian, and I was probably a little too excited as I realized that I had in fact not forgotten all my Italian — I read through the website almost as easily as I would French, which was a pretty amazing feeling, and despite how quickly my bank account’s balance dwindled, I regretted nothing.   </span></div>

I seemed to be the only non-white person in the room (sadly, a feeling that has become not unfamiliar in the past few months), and perhaps the only person who didn’t speak any of the four languages that were the focus of the talks today, and when someone greeted me in Scottish Gaelic, I struggled to find an answer until he said, in English this time, “Oh, do you not speak Gaelic?”
                            <br><br>
                            
                            At least the majority of the event was in English, even though if it were entirely in Gaelic I would have stayed anyway. It began with a half-hour talk between a business professor who was interested in international development and Celtic languages and three PhD students who were studying Celtic Studies, each working from a slightly different angle and focusing on different languages. They went through issues such as why minority languages mattered (a question that arises occasionally in linguistic circles as well), a brief history of the three students’ involvement with language activism and preservation, and what still needed to be accomplished in the future. One of the students likened the struggle to preserve minority Celtic and Germanic languages in the British Isles to the struggle to preserve First Nations languages in Canada, and I thought about UBC’s extensive work with First Nations languages, especially in the linguistics department.   </span></div>

It was supposed to start at 7:00pm, and I was surprised at how many people were in the lecture theatre, compared to the event that I had attended on Tuesday; it seemed at least half-full, which was quite impressive because the lecture theatre was relatively large. <br><br>
                            
                            I found a seat, and the panelist speakers soon started talking about why they were screening this movie and what its significance was to the LGBTQ+ fight, and what their personal connection to the fight was — they were activists and professors and other people involved in the movement, and they talked about the history of LGBTQ+ rights in Britain.  </span></div>

I didn’t quite feel like participating in the games, but I retrieved my laptop and ended up sitting in the living room with the rest of them, calmly studying Norwegian and Danish as they loudly cheered and yelled and shouted throughout their games. <br><br> Stephanie messaged me at one point, admitting that she felt intimidated by all the blond Americans in one room and thus hadn’t stayed in the kitchen; I told her that the feeling of being a fish out of water, so different from everyone else, had long ceased to be a novel feeling.   </span></div>

It was cold but not unbearable as I headed out, taking the route by Cowgate which passed Three Sisters. I thought about the day that Tonje and I had walked to Dean Village — I was glad that there was no snow anymore, although the ground was still pretty wet from rain, and I passed the castle and continued heading forward. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            I was now in a part of town that I had never explored before, although I passed a number of bookstores — I made a mental note to come back here again someday and properly explore this part of town — and other interesting shops and stores. The bakery was located on a street called Bread Street, which I thought was hugely appropriate, although when I finally found it, I was a bit surprised at how small it was; for some reason, given the event’s popularity on Facebook, I had imagined a slightly bigger bakery. Nonetheless, I headed in, where I chose two scones — a strawberry and prosecco flavoured one (I wondered what alcohol-flavoured scones would taste like) and a carrot cake flavoured one — and paid three pounds for the two of them.

Noah had told me about the museum, and it was filled with interesting objects from a variety of world religions, ranging from Christianity to Buddhism to Hinduism. 
                            <br><br>
                            The most interesting wing was an exhibit on how different religions treated various parts of life, such as birth and marriage and death, and it featured a variety of objects with detailed captions — for the display case on marriage, for example, a white bridal gown was placed next to a traditional Bengali wedding dress, and a small doll was dressed up in bright red traditional Chinese clothing. I thought about wedding pictures that I had once seen of my parents, and then about my cousin whose engagement feast we had attended last winter, and finally wondered what kind of marriage, Chinese or western, I’d end up having in the far future. Each section of the exhibit was also translated into four languages, Urdu, Chinese (in traditional characters), Scottish Gaelic, and Punjabi, with the addition of Hindi if the section dealt with Hinduism, and I spent almost as much time attempting to read the languages as I did looking at the objects in the display cases.

                            Next to Princes Square, I followed Argyll Arcade, which was a sort of shopping street that was devoted primarily to jewelry stores (each storefront was full of shimmering, sparkling objects) and which led out onto Argyle Street. Glasgow Central Station was only a few blocks away, so I decided to explore that area, and I walked briefly around the station to see what would catch my eye. 
                            <br><br>
                            The entrance to an establishment called The Arches looked interesting, and I peeked inside — I couldn’t tell exactly what it was, although large black letters on the side of the entrance proclaimed “Est. 2018” which meant that it had just recently opened, so I decided to take a look. I followed a short hall which opened into a dark cavern illuminated by bands of coloured light, reds and yellows and purples and pinks; food stalls lined one section of the Arches, while picnic tables, full of people eating and socializing, filled the rest of the area. It was unfortunate that I was still full from the cafe earlier, because some of the food looked really good — I glanced at all the menus, which featured items such as ice cream tacos, Indian street food, Vietnamese cuisine, creme brûlée in four different flavours, mini burgers, and fancy cocktails. I decided that if I were ever to come back to Glasgow, I really wanted to try some of this food.   </span></div>

                        <div class = "twentyfivetext"> <span class = "onesentence"> <b class = "osb"> April 1</b><br><br>We soon reached Three Sisters, and Nick and I walked around a bit in the pub and in the outside area, looking at all the food on offer. There was a barbecue stall, a burrito stall, a curry stall, and a pizza stall, along with all the dessert stalls that caught my attention, featuring fudge, cupcakes, and the most popular stall of them all, rolled ice cream, where the line seemed to stretch across half of Three Sister’s outdoor area. Nick was hungry enough to want an actual meal, so he picked a burrito (and let me steal a bite), although I had come for the ice cream, and after we examined the menu together, we decided to both order a different rolled ice cream and each taste half of both flavours. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            One of them featured a Kinder Happy Hippo (I had never seen one before) and chocolate Baileys, and the other featured Ferrero Rocher and Kahlua, both topped with chopped nuts and whipped cream and drizzled with chocolate sauce, and we chatted as we waited in line — we compared ice cream and frozen yogurt chains from back home, he commented that this street food festival was reminding him of county fairs in New England, and he told me stories from having worked at a lemonade stand one summer. Finally, we reached the front of the line, watched the rolled ice cream being made in front of us, and took lots of pictures of the finished product; it looked delicious and tempting, especially because it was the first ice cream that I was eating in months. 
                            <br><br>

                            We tried to see if we could visit Edinburgh Castle, but the entrance fee was a bit expensive and it was already growing late in the day, so we decided to come back another time. Instead, we admired the view of the city below, looking out towards Princes Street in the other direction and pointing out familiar landmarks, from the shops along Princes Street to the tram running through the city to the train that occasionally passed below us on its way into Waverley. We talked about the memories that we had made in this city over the last few months, and the experiences that we had been lucky enough to enjoy — “A lot of students, when they’re graduating, say that exchange was the best part of university. Would you agree?” I asked Nick contemplatively; he answered affirmatively.  </span></div>

Badminton was much less surprising, and she told us to have fun and take pictures as Nick and I headed out. It was my first time at the Pleasance gym, which was located just one minute down the street, and after we entered and paid for the court, he showed me around a bit as I joked that this was his second home (it was probably one of the few places that he frequented much more than I did). It was large and fancy, or at least I thought so, because I didn’t have many gyms to compare it to, and Nick showed me the weightlifting room that Noah was usually in, although our other roommate wasn’t around today. I asked Nick which areas he usually frequently, and he declared that he was usually all over the place, although the basketball courts on which badminton was played was a slightly unfamiliar area for him as well.
                            <br><br>
                            
                            We headed downstairs and reached the badminton courts, where three courts, two of them already occupied, had been set up. Nick and I took the court at the farthest end of the gym, and soon we rallied a few times to warm up. It had been years since I had last played, and I was at the moment more used to the feel and weight of ping pong paddles, although after a few rallies, the badminton racket began to feel as familiar and comfortable as it had been during high school. The familiar movement of the swing, the sound of the racket hitting the birdie, and the arc that the birdie traced through the air as it hurtled towards the other side of the court were all feelings that I had missed, and I was glad that Nick had agreed to come play with me today.

She asked me if my high school experiences in Canada had resembled the one portrayed in the movie, and I probably surprised her with my negative answer — my upbringing, despite being in a western country, was probably still a lot more Chinese than she would have expected. I explained that there had been more Asians than white students at my high school, and my high school life had mostly revolved around studying and exams, and much less around parties and socializing.

                            I stayed in the kitchen for most of the rest of the night, and at various points Noah and Stephanie found out what I had been doing earlier this evening. I had never heard of the movie Love, Simon before tonight, but apparently it had been quite popular on social media, and both Noah and Stephanie had really wanted to see it — Noah had actually gone to the theatres yesterday, only to find out that it wasn’t released yet, and I said I could have invited him if I had known that he wanted to go.  </span> </div>

                        <div class = "twentyfivetext"> <span class = "onesentence"> <b class = "osb"> April 4</b><br><br>An hour of socializing and networking, accompanied with generous amounts of delicate and fancy food, followed the event, and as I tried the various canapés, ranging from macarons in a variety of flavours to small breads and fried balls of dough stuffed with filling, I ended up chatting with a couple other students who had attended the event today. They were all exchange or international students from China, and conversation started off in English before switching to Chinese. Like most Chinese people, they were surprised that I actually spoke Chinese, and I was reminded of 1.5 syndrome again, which I hadn’t had to think about for a while. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            The conversation topic that we jumped to most immediately was the fourth talk on Tiananmen, and one of the Chinese girls, an exchange student from a university that I had never heard of, admitted that she had never learned much about the protests, because in school her teachers had always told her that it was just a lie. The other two students admitted that they knew that such an event had occurred in 1989, but they weren’t very knowledgeable about it, and nobody ever spoke about it, because it was a censored topic and doing so could lead to consequences. I added that even though I had grown up in Canada and learned about the events of 1989 through materials and books that were banned in China, my parents had never really wanted to talk about it and had asked me not to ask them questions about it. 
                            <br><br>
                            All I knew was that my parents had been twenty-one years old and in university in 1989 — practically the same age that I’d be this June (technically, I’d be twenty and eleven months, but the difference was insignificant) — and that Dad had been studying at Shanghai Jiaotong, undoubtedly one of the schools which had shown their support to the students from the Beijing universities. I remembered discussing the protests with Sophie once, in our long French messages when we had used to send each other long tumblr messages, and trying to learn more and grapple with my own thoughts and feelings regarding what had happened in my birth country.

                            The movie that I had seen earlier made me happy and excited to go home in two months, the conversation with Yash from high school had been an unexpected but very welcome surprise, the weather was beautiful and it was actually warm for once (all traces of yesterday’s winter had melted away), and Alyssa’s roommate Yash was always nice to bump into and talk to. I headed past Salisbury Court and past Pollock Halls and continued on, not bothering to check my phone to verify that I was going in the right direction — I was simply enjoying the warmth and the sun and the illusion of freedom, and the destination wasn’t as important as the journey.  </span> </div>

The topic of conversation was Luxembourg for a while, since nobody knew very much about the country that Felix was from, so he told us about the size of the country, comparing it to Hong Kong, and about all the languages that people from Luxembourg spoke. I remembered doing a research project on Luxembourg in IB French, and being jealous at their linguistic abilities — they spoke Luxembourgish, of course, and French and German, and English was mandatory, and many people in Luxembourg were immigrants so that they spoke their heritage language as well, and Felix concluded that four or five languages was quite ordinary.

Tesco was on the way home for me, so I headed along with them, walking again mostly with Daniel, although we were all listening with great amusement to one of Felix’s stories about getting drunk in Shanghai, missing his stop on the metro, and ending up in some suburb that was practically in Zhejiang province (once again, I was so glad to be among a group of people who were all familiar with Shanghai).   </span></div>

The weather forecast called for rain and gloomy clouds later today, but the early morning weather was magnificent — the sun gradually rose above the clouds, painting them with hues of sunrise pink and orange; brillant rays of light illuminated the inside of the train carriage. Sunrise was a rather rare sight, especially since I knew that the sun’s appearance wouldn’t last, but the fleetingness of the beauty only reminded me to appreciate it even more. Squinting out the window, I tried to appreciate the sunrise for as long as I could, even despite the dark, threatening clouds rolling in from the horizon; for the moment, the sunrise was so beautiful that it made my heart ache. 
                            <br><br>

                            The last place that we wanted to explore was the lakeside, which was actually a twenty minutes’ walk from the actual town of Ambleside. We headed down the street, passing through the town again and in a slight southerly direction; the rain had started falling again, and the road was empty except for the occasional car or tourist. Soon, the gray waters of the lake came into sight again, and like at Bowness, a number of rowboats, sailboats, and other seafaring vessels lined the water’s edge. A handful of docks and piers stretched into the water as well, and Stephanie and I took a couple artistic pier photos, even though the colour of the piers rather blended into the colours of the lakes. 
                            <br><br>
                            Finally, for the final few minutes before we had to head back to the bus stop, I simply stood at the edge of the pier, looking out at the lake and the distant mountains rising in the distance — these hadn’t really been the views that I had been hoping for today, but the Lake District was still beautiful, even despite the dreary weather, and despite everything, I was glad that we had visited today.

One presentation was on the evolution of English negation, and although I didn’t have too much background on the subject apart from very general knowledge on the evolution of the English language, I did recognize some parallels with the evolution of French negation, and the Middle English and Old English was very fun to try to read. <br><br> At one point, the presenter began with the line, “I’m sure you all know that…” and while I wasn’t actually familiar with the publication on Jespersen’s Cycle that he cited (I didn’t even know what Jespersen’s Cycle itself was), I liked how we were an entire room full of linguistics nerds who had, to some extent, the same foundational knowledge in linguistics, and in most cases, the line, “I’m sure you all know that...” emphasized this connection that we all had.

                            We were walking across the entirety of Holyrood Park to Salisbury Crags because, Matthew claimed, this was the scenic route, but it was actually quite grey and cloudy and deep puddles of mud and swampy ground covered the trail. A couple dogs curiously came up to us, and one of them displayed great interest in the pulled pork sandwich wrapper that Matthew had stuffed into his backpack. <br><br>
                            
                            We continued walking along nonetheless, chatting mostly about languages and linguistics, which was always a fun topic among nerds like us — Saskia mentioned at one point that she had an extremely difficult time learning French, even though she had picked Polish of all languages as her main second language, along with a couple other languages that were much more distant from her native English than French was. Matthew started reciting the numbers one to ten in a bunch of random languages, such as Swedish and German, while I thought about the languages that I would need for my upcoming travels to countries such as Denmark and the Netherlands. We talked about how studying linguistics didn’t necessary mean learning a bunch of languages, but how it was common for linguistics students to learn a bunch of languages anyway, and mutually complained about the most common misconceptions that other people had about our field of study, most notably, “Linguistics? So how many languages do you study?”   </span> </div>

                            The flight was barely two hours long, but in that span of time, the view outside my window changed from sunset pink and baby blue to the deep colours of sunset to the lights of Denmark’s capital city glittering just below us. It had been a week since I had seen glittering lights at night — the last time had been catching a glimpse of Glasgow at night from the bus heading back from the Lake District — but this time I thought about a conversation that I had had with someone during the conference. I didn’t remember who I had been talking to, but I remembered the story about the Coldplay song with the line, “Lights will guide you home.” For some reason, the glittering lights seen from the window of the airplane felt like stars.

Once I had passed the ticket desk, the rest of the climb was relatively quicker, although some parts of the stairs were narrow and steep and we shuffled to the side to allow other visitors to carefully make their way down. 
                            <br><br>
                            As we ascended, the stairs gradually grew steeper and narrower with each passing floor, and soon we had arrived at the final staircase, which would take us to the base of the black-and-gold tower. This staircase was so steep that it was practically a ladder, and once we arrived at the top, we emerged onto a sort of platform, squinting our eyes against the fierce wind that immediately rushed into us as soon as we came out into the open. A number of people had concluded their ascent up the tower at this point, because the rest of the climb, we had been warned, was not for the faint-hearted — the spiral staircase led ever higher, narrowing the entire time, until it was barely the width of a single person with their feet pressed as closely together as possible, and in the strong wind that didn’t show any signs of letting up, the experience could induce vertigo.

                            I spent most of the time admiring the view from the platform, which was already at a considerable height over the city. Although the weather wasn’t as brilliantly-sunny as it had been earlier, as some clouds had drifted in and dimmed the sunlight, I could still see for quite a distance. In one direction, I spotted Christiansborg Palace, and in another, I could make out the approximate location of Nyhavn, even though I couldn’t see the coloured buildings themselves. Open water, as blue as the sky, was visible in the far distance.

I stopped multiple times to take photos of the architecture — I loved the colours of all the buildings, which ranged from soft pastel shades to deep brilliant hues, one after another along the gently-curved streets like rows of crayons in a crayon box. Window displays caught my attention as well — one in particular was completely in a soft shade of pink, and the letters “LOVE” were artfully arranged among the products that it displayed.

It turned out to be a huge Danish design store, and I had barely started exploring the first floor when I was already as enamoured as I had been with the German Christmas store in York. I walked through room after room, visually feasting on the display of the pinnacle of Danish design — everything looked incredibly photogenic and aesthetic, and it almost could have been an exhibition hall of some sort instead of a store, even despite the price tags hanging from the items. 
                            <br><br>
                            Each area had a different theme, from gardening and decorative plants to Christmas ornaments and sculptures (it was the middle of April, but Christmas-themed items were beautiful any time of the year). Chandeliers and lamps lit up one corner of a floor, while furniture and interior decorating occupied another corner. I flipped through racks of postcards and posters, some depicting Denmark or Copenhagen, and found a black and white hand-drawn postcard with a world map and an arrow pointing to Copenhagen, with the caption, “I’m right here! …and I’m loving it.” I sent a picture of it to Tonje, because that was exactly how I was feeling right now.  </span></div>

I had passed an advertisement plastered on a bus stop earlier that read, “I love Berlin,” with a heart made up of Berlin’s most famous icons, and I hoped that by the time that I left the city, I’d feel the same way. </span></div>

The memorial featured black-and-white photos from the time period, showing what this precise street looked like when the Wall had divided the city, and providing individual stories from the people who had lived here and whose lives had been shaped by the Wall. There were black-and-white photos and lists of names of those who had perished at the Wall — some of them were teenagers or even young children, and it hurt to think about those who had been killed by their own people — although, slightly more optimistically, there were also stories of those who had successfully escaped or helped others to escape. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            There was a viewing platform across the street which provided a panoramic view of the entire memorial, which stretched out over a couple blocks along the street, and which was covered in more history, providing historical context from the time period outside of Berlin. I wandered into the exhibits on the first and second floor, looking at the photos, posters, and maps and reading the individual stories which were presented in the exhibits — these made the history come alive in a far more vivid manner than my old history textbooks ever did.

                            Finally, I returned across the street to finish looking through the rest of the memorial, and at one point, as I was looking at the graffiti that covered the sections of the Berlin Wall that were still standing, I was startled to find a quote in French that I recognized — it read, “C’est l’histoire d’un mur tombant. Mais l’important c’est pas la chute, mais l’atterrissage.” It was a reference to the French movie La haine that we had watched during FREN329 in Lyon two years ago, and it fit perfectly — the quote was significant both literally and figuratively, and both the movie and this memorial was about a divide that had split a European capital city.  </span></div>

In the distance, the TV tower soared above the rest of the city, although slightly to the south, Potsdamer Platz boasted a number of tall skyscrapers as well. The Brandenburger Tor was barely perceptible at the entrance to the park, and the Berliner Dom looked tiny, barely a blue-green marble in the distance. The Spree was visible in places, winding through the city, and I also caught sight of the Reichstag — it was amazing to realize how much I could see. I thought about a quote that I had seen online describing the experience of standing on top of the Siegessäule — “the wind is in your hair, and Berlin is at your feet.” It was without a doubt an amazing feeling.

I wandered into the old town square, perhaps the most recognizable part of Prague, and sent Ewen a short panorama because I wanted to share the moment with him — it was so lively and full of energy, and the church that I had seen in so many glossy photos was practically glowing silver in the night. I was already in love with this beautiful city, and my adventures had barely begun.

                        <div class = "twentyfivetext"><span class = "onesentence"> <b class = "osb"> April 19</b><br><br>I wandered around a bit, staring in surprise and a bit of confusion at a couple of statues of people dangling from umbrellas suspended high in the air (it wasn’t the first time that I had seen statues of people suspended mid-air in Prague, and I wondered why this was the case). I headed towards the river, passing the Dancing House for the third time in less than twenty-four hours, and then headed in a vaguely northern direction towards the Old Town Square, admiring the pretty buildings lit up with the warm glow of sunset — architecture in Prague was always very impressive, but during moments like these, it seemed to be especially stunning.
                            <br><br>

                            I soon reached the top of the astronomical clock tower, and I spent more than an hour simply admiring and soaking in the views from every direction. I could see the entire Old Town Square and the cathedral, and my view stretched over the rooftops of the buildings of the city towards the horizon — Prague Castle, a tall TV tower in the distance, and the mountains and hills surrounding the city centre were all visible and illuminated by the sun slowly sinking towards the horizon. I spent the most time looking in the direction of the sunset, because the sun set directly behind Prague Castle — I wondered if whoever had designed the astronomical clock tower had known that it’d line up so perfectly — and the sky was aglow with fiery, vivid colour. As the sun finally disappeared behind the castle, the sky turned a deep, intense orange, and I thought that this was without a doubt the most beautiful sunset that I had seen since I had left Vancouver.   </span></div>

                        <div class = "twentyfivetext"><span class = "onesentence"> <b class = "osb"> April 20</b><br><br>Luckily for me, because the midday sun was beating down quite strongly, it didn’t take long to reach the Metronome, and I soon leaned against the warm stone railing, listening to the mechanic “tick-tick-tick” coming from the Metronome that towered above me and admiring the view below. I could see the bridge that I had just crossed, as well as the old town square not too far away, and sweeping my gaze slightly to the right, Charles Bridge and the other bridges that crossed the river were visible; the pedestrians crossing the bridges seemed as tiny as ants. I wondered why Prague was full of such amazing views. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            Although the view was amazing, the spot seemed to be popular as a hangout area; groups of friends were casually sitting or even sunbathing on the wide stones, and I wondered what it would be like to be able to hang out here on a regular basis. The weather was amazing, Letna Park in which the Metronome was located was full of greenery that seemed to burst with vivid colour, and a cheerful atmosphere of summer pervaded the park, as if worries didn’t exist and everything was always bright and carefree. I took a picture of the sunlight illuminating the bright green leaves of a towering tree just above me, and messaged Yu Chen, “Can I just stay here forever?”
                            <br><br>

                            I walked along the river heading north to Charles Bridge, which was where I had decided that I wanted to watch the sunset. The riverside promenade wasn’t very long, so I took my time, savouring the atmosphere as well as the remainder of my crepe. The atmosphere was amazing — on a restaurant patio somewhere, a musician was strumming a guitar and filling the air with live music, while patrons ate and socialized at crowded wooden picnic tables with good food and beer. It was a warm spring day, and sunlight was sparkling on the water in a thousand dancing golden shards, while Petrin Tower loomed above the city just across the river. Prague seemed like a city that was too good to leave. </span></div>

                            Suzanne distributed maps to us all which outlined the route that we would be following today, and then the group of us set off. We began where we currently were — “We’re standing in the best place to talk about religion,” Suzanne declared, and someone asked, “In front of a church?” <br><br>“No, in the middle of the Red Light District!” She took us on a short walk around the Red Light District, explaining its history, how it was closely tied with religion and Amsterdam’s location as a port city, and present-day attitudes towards it.  </span></div>

Haile and I ended up climbing on top of the railing where I had seen other people sit this afternoon, and with our legs dangling off the side (a rooftop of the next building over was only a couple meters below us, so there was no danger of falling onto the street far below us), we took pictures and stared out at the wide expanse of the sky, waiting for it to darken. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            Slowly, streetlights and stars began shimmering as the sky turned a deep blue hue, and although the temperatures started slowly dropping as well, the moment was so magical that I didn’t want to leave. Haile and I chatted about our travel experiences so far as yet more streetlights flickered on — she told me about her time in Barcelona and her previous experiences in Germany and the friends that she had made during the program, and I told her about France and the other places that I’ve visited so far this semester. We ended up staying at the viewpoint until around 10:00pm before climbing off the railing — that one hour of sitting on what felt like the edge of a rooftop, watching sunset and twilight and the lights of the city, had been indescribably magical; it was quite simply the most amazing feeling. 
                            <br><br>

                            Finally, we headed through Grand Place and down a side street to the bar, Delirium, that Tonje had chosen. It was loud and crowded and filled with people, mostly men, and definitely not the kind of place that I felt at ease in — I much preferred the quiet, calm, peaceful atmosphere of the rooftop sunset that Haile and I had just come from — but it was a good experience to have once in a while. 
                            <br><br>
                            Tonje had already ordered her beer, and Haile and I both chose the beer that had the lowest alcohol percentage. It was called a Floris Apple, with 3% alcohol, and the bartender handed it to me with trails of alcohol still running down the glass; he had prepared it rhythmically, each action completed to the beat of the music that resonated through the bar. I took a sip once we returned to the table where Tonje was sitting, and to my surprise I actually liked it, but probably only because it was incredibly sweet and I could barely taste the alcohol — it tasted like fizzy apple juice, or perhaps like the German Apfelschorle that Ewen had recommended that I try in Berlin that I had never gotten the chance to.   </span></div>

Nick took one of me backlit by the sun, and I gazed at the city below, once more so grateful to call this place home. Sometimes, I realized, one just needed to climb a mountain to feel on top of the world. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            The wind picked up and the temperatures dropped slightly as we made the final climb up to the top of Arthur’s Seat, where all of Edinburgh lay below us and the wind whipped my hair into my face. I stood there for a while, letting my gaze wander over all the parts of the city that had become so familiar during the last few months and simply enjoying the feeling of standing at the top of Arthur’s Seat. Nick and Alyssa snapped some pictures and were soon ready to head down, but I didn’t want to leave just yet, so I told Nick that I’d see him soon back home and the two of them were soon just specks in the distance, heading down across the grassy plateau.

                        <div class = "twentyfivetext"><span class = "onesentence"> <b class = "osb"> April 28 </b><br><br>Afterwards, I headed off towards Portobello Beach, which was about an hour away on foot. The first half-hour of the walk was largely uninteresting, as I passed car washes and van rentals, and the only notable moment was when I spotted a bright yellow sign that read, “Find Love” (I didn’t know the context, but it was an attention-grabbing sign nonetheless). 
                            <br><br>
                            Luckily, the second half of the walk, once the Firth of Forth came into sight, was much more pleasant, and I listened happily to the sound of the waves crashing against the rocks and admired the wide, unending expanse of deep blue that stretched into the horizon, contrasting sharply with the lighter, brighter blue of the sky painted with wisps of white clouds. I felt content to be by such a large body of water after having not seen the ocean for so long — “This West Coast girl misses the ocean,” I thought. The Firth of Forth certainly wasn’t an ocean, but it was close enough — I could smell the salt in the air, and it reminded me of home.
                            <br><br>
                            
                            Portobello Beach was actually quite a long strip of sand, and on a bright, sunny, Saturday afternoon, it was filled with families and beachgoers. I stayed by the road and didn’t venture onto the sand — I was happy just to see the water, but I didn’t need to approach it too closely — and people-watched all along the stretch of the beach. I spotted children running across the sand, colourful kites billowing in the air behind them, and eager dogs dashing into the water to retrieve a ball. Older adults sat peacefully on benches, facing the ocean waves, while groups of friends played beach volleyball, their feet sinking into the soft sand as they dived for the ball. Children lined up at ice cream trucks and adults at coffee stands, and I felt the wind whipping through my hair and watched the waves rhythmically advance and recede while seagulls cawed and spiraled overhead.  </span></div>

At one point, conversation was focused on the new and surprising foods that we had discovered in Edinburgh and the UK, and most of them were new to me as well, such as black pudding, haggis, and Yorkshire puddings. 
                            <br><br>
                            Then, one of the girls burst out that she had discovered the extremely strange combination of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and the other girls admitted in a doubtful tone that they’d be reluctant to try such a combination, while I was just astounded to discover that this was at all new and unexpected. In North America, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches were practically a staple of childhood lunch boxes (not particularly in my case, because my lunch boxes tended to be filled with dumplings and chao mian, but I knew that other children ate such sandwiches for lunch). Even months into exchange, it was still incredible to realize how much I was learning about the world.

                            On the other side of the National Monument, some performers were throwing around flames and juggling with fire, which reminded me of the performances that I had glimpsed in Prague from the top of the Astronomical Clock Tower. I could see slightly better this time, and soon the procession came through the Fire Arch, and judging from the “Ooh!”s and “Aah!”s coming from the audience, something impressive was happening, but from my point of view, all I could see was the tips of the flames dancing in the air.

We didn’t get around to meeting until almost 6:00pm — luckily Black Medicine was open until 8:00pm — and I ordered a cheese and vegetable filled croissant at the counter upstairs before heading downstairs to find the corner table that she had chosen; she had already started eating her filled bagel and coffee. <br><br>It was a comfortable, cozy location, with cushions on the wooden benches and a fish tank containing some kind of jet-black aquatic creature, although the music was blasting just a little too loud for my tastes.

                            The food came relatively quickly, and it was a pretty large bowl of nachos with cheese, sour cream, salsa, and guacamole for the two pounds that we had each paid. I was hungry enough to eat much more quickly than my usual speed, although Maggy and I still had a very lively conversation during dinner, chatting in Chinese because I didn’t have enough of a chance to speak this language. I was in the middle of exams, but Maggy didn’t have any finals at all because all her classes were project- and paper-based, so she told me about her plans for Copenhagen and Mumbai, adding that she kind of wanted to check out Sweden while she was in Denmark, because it was so close, and she wanted to cycle around Denmark as well because she was spending so many days in the capital city.
                            <br><br>
                            
                            ...
                            <br><br>
                            
                            At one point, chatting about exchange, Maggy asked me what had been the most difficult or challenging part of exchange, and for her answer, she said that adjusting to the cultural differences and the language barrier had been a considerable challenge, especially because she had never really left Taiwan for such a long period of time before. Many of my Asian friends had cited the same challenge, because while we from North America found Europe different in many ways, those from Asia found the entirety of Western culture different in even more ways.

                            Maggy suggested that this was perhaps one of the reasons the exchange students from Asia liked to stick together so closely — I knew that the HKU students were all really close friends, as were the Fudan students, while I still barely knew any of the other UBC students — because they were craving some reminder of a familiar culture, of a familiar lifestyle, of a familiar way of thinking. I mentioned living in a co-ed unit as one of the most significant differences from life back at UBC, and Maggy was surprised that I’d be okay with living with guys at all — another opinion shared by many of my female Asian friends — but Nick and Noah were cool and easy to get along with, and I was better friends with them than I had been with many of my roommates in the past.  </span> </div>

It was a surprisingly sunny view, and immediately Ireland was proving itself to be a very beautiful country.

                            Stephanie and I also discussed how our exchange semester was coming to an end, and I offered that at least my American friends wouldn’t be too far away from me — just a couple thousand kilometers across the continent — while my European friends would be much harder to say goodbye to, because who knew when I would next find myself in Europe? “Like me,” Stephanie said pointedly, and she was certainly right about that — this odd bunch of roommates would be especially difficult to say goodbye to; I had never imagined that I’d bond so closely with the three students whom I found myself sharing living spaces with. We talked about the possibility of her visiting Vancouver in the future — she had a close friend who was planning to move to Vancouver, so she told me that she’d let me know if she ever came as well, and I promised that I’d show her around my city.  </span></div>

Stephanie and I both ate a donut for lunch, saving the rest for later (we laughed about how the guys were probably at the gym right now, while we were enjoying sugar-laden donuts for lunch) — she really liked the maple bacon flavour, while I enjoyed my chocolate orange donut, and afterwards she glanced contemplatively at the counter, wondering how bad it’d look if she immediately went up to buy another donut. After struggling with temptation for a couple moments, she headed up to buy a coffee-flavoured donut, but afterwards declared that it hadn’t been as good as the maple bacon donut.

Somehow, conversation meandered from the exhibits in the museum to the donuts that were still waiting for us downstairs in the coat check, and Stephanie admitted that she kind of wanted to drop by The Rolling Donut again on her way to the bus stop that would take us to the airport, except that the same people would probably still be working there and they’d most likely recognize her if she went back for the third time in a single day.  </span> </div>

She offered me a bite as well — I kind of already missed the donuts from Dublin, so I took a bite as well, and then Stephanie exclaimed that Nick had to make Noah take a bite as well, so that the four of us would have all taken a bite out of the same donut. Noah was currently in the shower, but Nick pounded on the bathroom door anyway, and Noah actually turned off the water and came to open the door. He took a bite out of the donut and remarked that it wasn’t the best donut that he had ever tasted, and Stephanie reminded them that it had been sitting in her room for two days, while I was just laughing at the absurdity of Nick interrupting Noah mid-shower to make him eat a bite of Stephanie's donut.

I would almost certainly have a tamer life in residence back home, although this kind of excitement and entertainment had been a very memorable change for a semester.

I asked him if he and Noah had started to consistently visit the gym together — they had always used to go to the gym separately, because they followed different schedules and preferred different workouts, but Nick admitted that gymming together was actually quite fun, and he wished that they had started doing so earlier in the semester. I laughed that Stephanie had declared that she was very fond of their bromance, and Nick agreed that he had interesting relationships with all of us — there was his “bromance” with Noah, as Stephanie liked to call it, he and Stephanie had a sort of sibling-like relationship (“I love Stephanie,” he declared laughingly, despite how much effort she put in to annoy him), and I was apparently the only normal one. 
                            <br><br>
                            “Aren’t you glad you have at least one normal roommate?” I asked brightly.

Then, I changed his phone language to Slovenian — by this point, Nick could tell that I wasn’t just looking for music anymore, and I proudly showed my work to Stephanie, asking with great delight, “Isn’t this beautiful?” I was laughing like a mad person, but getting to wreck havoc occasionally was actually really fun, and this was an excellent method of stress reduction.

                            Eventually, the two of them left the kitchen, and I resumed my studying. Noah came back into the kitchen — “You missed all the fun,” I told him, updating him about the antics that he had just missed, although he seemed content to have been absent. Afterwards, Nick was the only roommate who I saw again, as he poked his head into the kitchen to tell me that he had just been about to send a text to a friend when he had realized that the keyboards that I had randomly installed on his phone were still there, but he had decided to keep them instead of deleting them. Somehow, that conversation led to a conversation about staying in touch in the future, and we promised to send each other messages and Snapchats occasionally; Nick also added that he wanted to visit Shanghai one day, and I hoped that I’d be there when he did so.

We headed back into my room to watch a movie, and Tonje pulled out the chocolate-covered cookies that she had brought as a movie snack. After a few moments, I suggested watching a movie in Chinese, because we had watched something in Norwegian the last time that we had spent an evening together and she had never seen an Asian movie before. I had been wanted to watch Chungking Express again recently, after having seen it during first year, and it was easily available with subtitles in multiple languages, including English.

                            It had been long enough that I didn’t remember all the details of the movie, and there were some cultural references that Tonje probably didn’t pick up despite the subtitles, but I really liked the movie and I hoped that she did too. I explained some parts of it to her, eager to share east Asian culture with someone unfamiliar with it — the scene with the durian was particularly interesting, and I told her about the time during first year when a building in my residence had had to evacuate because it smelled like a gas leak, but it turned out to be just someone eating durian. The languages were also an excellent bonus — I was really curious to see if a person who didn’t speak any Asian languages could tell the difference between Mandarin and Cantonese, and I pointed out each scene where the movie switched languages. </span></div>

Nick eagerly reminded me that Harvard University, drawling out the name in a very exaggerated Boston accent, was located near Boston, and I burst out that my friend studied at Harvard (“Savage,” Nick commented) although he was from Vermont. “That’s a small rural town!” Nick burst out, because he had earlier been trying to convince me that his town with a population of 18 000 wasn’t a small rural town (after all these months, I still didn’t believe him), and I laughed that it was actually a state. Nick told me in great detail about his perception of Vermont, which he didn’t seem to like very much (he mentioned the rampant drug problems and how Vermont had little other than Ben and Jerry’s to offer, “but you can find Ben and Jerry’s everywhere”), and concluded that New Hampshire was the greatest state in the world.

Unfortunately, since I didn’t have any Italian family members that could cook Italian food for me, I had come to Italy to taste authentic Italian food, and Linda and I walked a couple blocks to see what we could find.

                            “I’m twenty,” I assured her, adding that I knew that I looked younger than my age.

                            Florence reminded me of Lyon in many ways, and the gardens and hills and greenery on the other side of the river was just one characteristic that the two cities shared. Ponte Vecchio, unsurprisingly, was full of people, but the buildings that hugged the side of the bridge were quite unique — they seemed to be attached to the bridge the way a treehouse would be nestled in a tree. I took my time crossing it, passing by souvenir shops and groups of tourists with cameras and selfie sticks, and stopped for a few moments to admire the view of the bridges downriver which spanned the length of the very yellow Arno.

                            The Basilica of Santa Maria Novella, which the train station in which I had arrived yesterday was named after, was only a short walk away, so I headed through some narrow streets until I reached the piazza that it was located in. Despite the thick clouds that were now rolling in, it was a beautiful piazza — the basilica itself was an impressive sight, of course, but the thick border of bright pink flowers which lined the piazza added a splash of vibrancy to the scene that I particularly liked. A man with a guitar and a crooning voice was giving a musical performance in the centre of the piazza, and judging from the size of the crowd that he had attracted, his performance was quite remarkable.   </span></div>

Although large swathes of the city were still covered by the shadows of clouds, it was already much brighter than it had been earlier, and I could see for quite a distance in all directions. <br><br>
        
                            I slowly made my way around the entire top of the tower, lingering in every direction to admire the sheer prettiness of the Florentine rooftops and the mountains and parks in the distance. I picked out all the sights that I recognized, from the Palazzo Vecchio to the Arno to Piazzale Michelangelo to the Uffizi; in another direction, I spotted the Santa Maria Novella and the central market (it appeared even larger from this height) and the train station. Ordinary buildings were packed quite densely together, although a number of them featured balconies and rooftop patios and what appeared to be communal areas, and I imagined that on a sunny day, they’d be packed with the residents of the building. Looking around, I couldn’t help thinking once more that Florence reminded me so much of Lyon.
                            <br><br>

                            The sun had already set by the time I left the market, and I decided to head down to the river before returning to my hostel. The streets were brightly-illuminated, lighting up the buildings by the side of the road in a sort of golden colour, and I walked slowly in the direction of the Arno, admiring the nighttime scene. I soon reached the bridge, and the view from the middle of the bridge, looking out over the water, was even more beautiful than I had expected — the reflections of the streetlights along the river rippled gently in the water, while the faintest hues of orange and yellow were still barely visible on the western horizon. I stood in the center of the bridge for a few minutes, admiring the scene and wishing that I had left the market a bit earlier to admire the sunset, which would have been undoubtedly gorgeous.

I chose two nutty flavours for my last gelato in Italy, pistachio and hazelnut, and the small cup of gelato came with a wafer on top. I took small spoonfuls of the sweet gelato as I walked the final few blocks to the train station, savouring the flavours — I decided that these two flavours were my favourite gelato flavours of all the ones that I had tasted in Italy.

                            Noah told me that he and Stephanie had been discussing the idea of having a “family goodbye dinner” one of these days before we all left, especially because Stephanie was leaving quite a few days before the rest of us. We sighed that it’d be difficult to say goodbye and that our strange little dysfunctional family had gotten along so well — “If I hated just one of you,” Noah mused, “it’d be so much easier to leave.”

                            I asked him about his relationship with Stephanie — out of everyone, Noah and Stephanie was the most unlikely friendship, and Noah admitted that at the beginning of the semester, he didn’t think the two of them would get along because their personalities were so different. However, he added, ever since “that night she saved him,” the two of them had learned to understand each other better and become good friends. I brought up the idea that Nick had posed for the future, when he wanted to go on his road trip across the US and maybe visit me in Vancouver — Noah said that he hoped that Nick had an extra seat in his car, because he’d love to tag along, and when I offered happily that I’d love to have the both of them visit me in Vancouver, he enthusiastically pumped his fist into the air in victory — my roommates were really too cute, and I couldn’t believe how lucky I had been this semester.  </span></div>

                            This gave me over an hour to fully enjoy the sunshine and take a walk in the Meadows, which I had also recently wanted to do; cherry blossom season was already reaching its end, but there were still a few pink petals clinging to the trees that lined the paths through the Meadows, and I wanted to admire them before the wind blew the last of them onto the ground. I passed groups of people socializing, playing sports, barbecuing, and simply laughing with their friends — the Meadows, on a good day, always gave off such a nice atmosphere.
                            <br><br>
                            
                            I took a few pictures of the delicate pink cherry blossoms and bright green leaves against the cloudless blue sky, but there weren’t as many cherry blossoms left as I had hoped, and I wished that I had remembered to visit the Meadows earlier on during cherry blossom season. Nonetheless, I continued my walk through the Meadows, watching showers of cherry blossom petals gently drift to the ground — Nick had called this “fairy dust,” and the name seemed appropriate for the shimmering pink petals. There were entire flowers that had dropped onto the ground, and they looked as if they had just recently fallen — the petals hadn’t wilted yet — so I decided to collect a small handful of them to bring home. I didn’t know what I wanted to do with them, but perhaps they could be pretty somewhere.  </span></div>

One was a local Scottish student, who poured a bowl of cornflakes for himself and asked what language Tonje’s music was in, guessing first French and then German. Tonje gave him a big grin and pointed to herself, and he finally asked, “Norwegian?” She happily nodded yes, explaining that today was the Norwegian Constitution Day, and that was why we were listening to Norwegian music and eating a large breakfast together. 
                            <br><br>

                            We finally stopped at the memorial stone, just underneath the castle, for the last part of the official festivities today, a couple speeches and presentations by various members of the Scottish and Norwegian community. From the spot on the grass that my friends and I had chosen, it was a bit difficult to hear at times, but all the speeches were in English, except for the joyful "Gratulerer med dagen!” that concluded every presentation, followed by enthusiastic cheering. <br><br>
                            
                            The presenters, which ranged from executives of the Norwegian Student Association to Norwegian high school students studying in Edinburgh to city officials, gave speeches on the importance of this day in Norway and the celebration of independence, the history of Scottish-Norwegian relations, happy childhood memories related to this day (the consumption of ice cream and hot dogs featured prominently), and the values that this day celebrated, for Norwegian and Scottish people alike. Even though I hadn’t even known about the Norwegian national day before this year, and even though I had known nothing about Scottish-Norwegian relations, I felt as if a lot of the content of the presentations was very relatable because, in some way, it was so universal.  </span></div>

We met outside fifteen minutes later, and he gave me a warm hug as we greeted each other; I asked him how his exam had gone, and he didn’t sound terribly happy about it, but I figured that he had probably done alright. We headed out of New Arthur Place and towards South Bridge, and I asked him how he felt about leaving — we all only had a few days left, and none of us were terribly enthusiastic about leaving, but no matter how long we stayed, goodbyes never became easier. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            Yash offered that he was excited for what was coming next, though — he had a summer internship lined up in San Francisco (I started to wonder if that was a rite of passage for computer science students), and he had never visited San Francisco before, so he had that to look forward to. Meanwhile, I was going home to Shanghai, and to Japan, and then back home to Canada (“My, uh, other home,” I said, adding that I considered both places as home), where I had my normal, routine life to settle back into. We chatted about how much Edinburgh had grown on us during the last half-year, or, in his case, as he had been on exchange since last September, the last year. It had been an amazing experience for both of us, and we were both sad to say goodbye.

The sun was coloured in a brilliant crimson, matching the orange hues that coloured the eastern sky, and Yash found a spot on the rocks to sit and fully appreciate the view. I joined him, and Reigh sat with us as well; we all snapped a couple pictures, though none of our pictures could do justice to the spectacular view that we had been lucky enough to catch. I hadn’t seen such a brilliant sunrise in a long time — my early morning adventure in Prague had been fun, of course, but the sun had already assumed its usual colour by the time it had risen past the statues on Charles Bridge. This was truly a spectacular sight, and I was so glad that Yash had invited me this morning.

                            We stayed at the Salisbury Crags for a good half-hour, even though it was still quite cold; the temperatures wouldn’t rise until much later in the day. We continued watching the sunrise as it made its way up the sky, although I spent plenty of time admiring the view of the city washed in such a beautiful light as well — I spotted the docks of Leith, thinking about my walk there a couple weeks ago, and Calton Hill was just barely visible on the other side of the Crags. The view of Edinburgh just behind me grew only more and more stunning the higher the sun rose — this pale, golden light really was magical.  </span></div>

                            I had fewer PowerPoint slides to review today compared to yesterday, but I was also working at a slower pace, and our individual studying was peppered with as many discussions as we had had yesterday. In particular, the lecture on bilingualism in educational settings sparked a number of thoughts, as this was a topic that I frequently discussed with a number of people, ranging from conversations with Diptoman about the medium of instruction in Indian schools to conversations with Ewen about the language of instruction in Chinese or Hong Kong schools to conversations with Megan or Molly about French classes, both core and Immersion.

                            Tonje was quite surprised to learn most of this, and a tangent on the differences between elementary school in Norway and Canada (in Norway, Tonje explained, they had separate teachers for separate subjects, just like we did for high school) led us to the topic of the differences in society between Norway and Canada, as we discussed everything from health care to taxes. Everything came back to languages, however, and we discussed the value of learning basic linguistics when preparing to both teach and learn a foreign language, as well as general misconceptions about linguistics that we had encountered during our studies. It took me more than an hour to make my way through the slides of a single PowerPoint presentation, because we kept getting sidetracked by all our discussions, but I thought that they were absolutely worth it, and I thought that in the future, I would miss these kinds of conversations the most. </span></div>

We had been anticipating burgers for dinner tonight, but Nick ordered a salad, Noah wanted chicken wings, and Stephanie and I ended up being the only one to order burgers. After a bit of negotiation, we also decided to order a plate of nachos to share.

                            Nick, Stephanie, and I stayed a little longer because we didn’t have anywhere else to be later tonight, and conversation was even almost normal as we discussed Disney movies and favourite soundtracks and how cute our waiter was. Stephanie asked for another flask of water, laughing that it was an excuse to talk to the waiter again, and once we had all depleted the water and paid, we headed out of the restaurant. “Thank you!” Stephanie called politely to the waiter as we passed him, and Nick deviously whispered next to her, drawling out his words in a low tone, “The waiter’s cute.” Once we were safely out of the restaurant, Stephanie turned to him and exclaimed that she could never go back there again, now that he had embarrassed her.</span></div>

                            Roe sighed that the international image of Norway, at least online, was that it was such a fairytale, dreamlike country with no flaws, and Tonje gave quite an in-depth and thorough explanation of why this image didn’t reflect current political situations in Norway. She admitted that Norway in many aspects was an excellent place to live with a high quality of life — she had earlier mentioned wanting to take summer courses and “getting her university to pay for them,” and I had burst out, “I wish I could get my university to pay for my courses!” (to which she had replied, “Are courses expensive?” and I had grumbled, “Everything’s expensive”). <br><br>However, some people who held political power had very right-wing views that she didn’t agree with, and the longstanding belief that Norway was so much better than anywhere else had instilled a sort of arrogance and closed-mindedness amongst some people, she told us, to the point where they refused to accept anything that was different, that wasn’t Norwegian. She summed up the problem as, “Norway’s a great place to live — if you’re accepted into Norwegian society.”  </span></div>

Perhaps it was the thick layer of clouds that reduced everything to dull, muted colours that influenced my impression. </span></div>

Other exhibits surrounding the model focused on aspects such as sanitation (or, rather, the lack thereof) or industry in the old town. <br><br>
                            
                            A couple rooms further into the museum, I found the rooms devoted to the history of the new town — I learned that Princes Street Gardens had used to be a moat protecting Edinburgh Castle before it had turned into the public park that it was today, and I admired the maps that sketched out the layout of the streets of the new town. The names chosen for the streets were explained as well — Princes Street, George Street, and Queen Street obviously referenced the monarchy, while Rose Street and Thistle Street referenced the national plants of England and Scotland. On the walls were hung a few paintings depicting the new town as well; they were filled with straight lines and ninety-degree angles, and it was easy to see why they were considered so elegant.  </span></div>

I hadn’t realized that not all poppies resembled the Canadian poppy that I was used to seeing (I did think ours was the prettiest, though), and, perhaps naively, I hadn’t realized that not all countries associated the poppy with remembering the war in this way. Haile had never heard of the tradition, and I explained to her what Remembrance Day meant in Canada, and how we had always received poppies at school and attended Remembrance Day assemblies during elementary school and high school. It was such a normal part of growing up in Canada that it was almost strange to imagine that this was unfamiliar to someone who had grown up in another country.

Nick gave Betsy a hug, promising to visit them in Iowa someday, and then Betsy gave me a hug; I was really glad to have gotten to know her this semester, and I had probably gotten along better with her than with some of the other girls in the group. Then, Noah gave me a tight hug (it was our first and last hug, and I realized that his hugs were really good), and he told me that he’d miss me: “I’ll miss feeling stupid that you speak seven languages and I speak only one,” he added (I wanted to protest that I definitely did not speak seven languages, but I figured that by this point I probably couldn’t convince him anymore).   </span></div>

Haile suggested checking out the inside of the small house, and the temporary exhibition currently taking place ended up being one of my absolute favourite parts of the entire gardens, matched only by the gorgeous colours of the azalea lawn. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            The introduction to the exhibition stated that children were spending too much time indoors, in front of screens and games instead of outside playing in nature, and they were losing their ability to recognize even basic species of animals and plants. The exhibit aimed to reintroduce the magic of nature through watercolour paintings and nature poetry, featuring these words that “had been lost from the vocabulary of children.” I immediately fell in love as soon as I stepped into the first room of the exhibition — the delicate but richly-painted watercolours were gorgeous, reminding me of the high school years that I had spent painting and the animals that had constituted a majority of my subjects. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            The nature poems that accompanied the paintings were brilliant as well — they were meant to be read aloud, almost as if spells, but it was silent in the art exhibition so I simply mouthed the words to myself, imagining how powerful and filled with magic they would sound if spoken aloud. I loved the rhythm and the rhymes, the words bursting with imagery and imagination — they reminded me of William Blake and poetry analyses in ArtsOne, but in a good way. My favourite poem was Kingfisher, which opened with the line, “Kingfisher: the colour-giver, fire-bringer, flame-flicker, river’s quiver” — each word seemed to crackle with energy.  </span></div>

Unfortunately, when I realized that we couldn’t even see a church at the end of the road — “You’d see a church over there,” I told Daniel, pointing at a uniform gray mass of nothingness, “if it were visible” — I suggested that we spend the day in a museum instead. Specifically, I still hadn’t properly explored the National Museum of Scotland, despite having lived ten minutes away from the museum for the last five months.

Because it was vacation season and because the weather was so uncharacteristically impeccable today, the trail was packed with people; most of them seemed to be visitors, judging from the plethora of languages and accents that I heard. Daniel and I stopped occasionally on the way up so that he could admire the view and take photos — Leith and the water didn’t take long to come into sight — and even I was busy absorbing the views, realizing that this was my last climb up Arthur’s Seat, at least for this year. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            The climb wasn’t particularly long or difficult, especially considering some of the mountains back home in Vancouver, although I hadn’t climbed up Arthur’s Seat in more than a month and I realized that I hadn’t actually climbed up Arthur’s Seat itself very many times over the semester; many of my adventures in Holyrood Park had been restricted to Salisbury Crags or the lochs, which were much more accessible than the peak of the park. Daniel and I soon reached the flat hill immediately next to the peak itself, and since Arthur’s Seat looked incredibly crowded, we decided to stay here for a while. Daniel sat down on a smooth rock, while I admired the view below, pointing out to him all the most distinctive sights — the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the buildings of the University of Edinburgh, Scott Monument, Calton Hill, the Meadows.
                            <br><br>
                            
                            Eventually, we climbed up the final stretch to Arthur’s Seat, and Daniel and I found large, smooth rocks to sit on to soak in the views. We remained there for over an hour — contemplating a city from its highest point seemed to be my preferred way to say farewell to a city, considering that I had visited Fourvière for over an hour during my last days in Lyon — and I thought about my memories from this semester. I looked around at all the tourists and visitors passing through Edinburgh for a few days, and, as I had done a few weeks ago, thought about how lucky I was that I wasn’t one of them. Edinburgh wasn’t just a stop on the itinerary, a dot on the map — in these last five months, I had made it one of my homes.   </span></div>

                            We walked down Cockburn Street and across Waverley Bridge to Princes Street, where Aayush suddenly suggested stopping by a hidden bar that they had wanted to take me to once; it was located just off Princes Street, and I wondered why it was considered a hidden bar, as the sign advertising its name was placed quite prominently next to the door. It wasn’t open yet, as it was only noon and the bar didn’t open until a bit later in the day, but Karis carefully pushed open the door to reveal a long, dark staircase leading underground, and she promised that this wasn’t as sketchy as it looked. The three of us headed down the stairs, where at the bottom, a talking statue of a head startled us with an annoyed, “Let me guess, you want to wish for unlimited money. Unfortunately, I only deal in Vietnamese currency.” 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            The head was attached to another door, and Karis carefully pushed open this one, too, revealing the actual bar itself. It looked more or less like a typical bar, with tables and beers on tap; only one employee was currently around. Karis asked him if the bar was open yet, and he said no, but allowed us to take a look around; Karis and Aayush explained that I was on exchange and my time in Edinburgh was coming to an end, so they were just showing me around as much of Edinburgh as they could. The sound of barking came from the little back room that the employee was currently working in, and Karis asked curiously if it was a dog. <br><br>
                            
                            “Come say hi,” the employee said, and out of the room trotted a small pug, who curiously sniffed at us and enjoyed the attention that Karis and Aayush immediately showered on him. “His name is Winston,” the employee told us. After a few moments, the pug momentarily returned to the back room to retrieve his favourite toy, which he spent the rest of our visit carrying around as he followed us at our heels.  </span></div>

I spent a while simply staring up and admiring the Great Hall, trying to recognize as many figures as I could.

                            It was already past 7:00pm when I was finally ready to lock my bedroom door for the last time and leave New Arthur Place — I was tired enough from an entire afternoon of packing and cleaning that I almost didn’t have the energy to feel bittersweet about this last parting, but I took a moment to say “See you” out loud before finally closing the door and turning the key in the lock. Then, with my suitcase, my backpack, my purse, and my laptop in my arms, I left New Arthur Place and watched the black gate shut behind me.  
                            <br><br>
                            
                            The weather was surprisingly pleasant — it was nice of the sky above Edinburgh to be blue and bright as I left the city. I first dropped off my key at the building where I had picked it up, five months ago — I remembered how lost I had been, trying to find New Arthur Place the first time — and then passed Lister, where I had attended lectures and tutorials alike, and Black Medicine, one of my favourite study cafes. I headed down South Bridge to Piemaker, where I was planning to eat a quick dinner before heading to the bus station — Piemaker was cheap and filling and convenient, and a fitting last meal in this city.  </span></div>

I messaged Diptoman, asking him for recommendations for Bengali candy and desserts, even though I knew that by the time he saw my message, I’d have had left London already. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            Although the Bangladeshi presence was very strong, the area was also home to other immigrant communities, so as a result I passed quite a few Italian and French restaurants as well. Aside from food, the street art which Brick Lane was known for wasn’t specific to a single culture or country, and I enjoyed wandering down the street and being surprised by a new piece at every turn. Some were impressive in size and colour and detail, while others were small but imaginative and quirky. Among the ones that stood out the most to me were a girl picking flowers, silhouetted against a colourful sunset background; blue-gray glass-looking sculptures of ducks and dogs; and a giant, vividly-colourful mural at the end of a street featuring a Bengal tiger, fierce tongues of flickering flame, and a humanoid creature combining both animal and plant characteristics. 
                            <br><br>

                            Finally, the flight to Shanghai was about an hour and a half, and I managed to ask for a window seat — I watched the glittering orange lights of Wuhan gleam like sparkling ribbons as we soared into the sky, and although clouds obstructed my view for the majority of the flight, I was treated to an amazing view of Shanghai once the plane started its descent, one hour later.<br><br>
                            
                            I had always flown into Shanghai from Vancouver, and I had never been lucky enough to sit in the window seat in the past, but flying east from Wuhan meant that we flew over all of Shanghai on our way to Pudong. I was glued to the window as I tried to recognize as many landmarks as I could — Hongqiao was large and bright in the night, Lujiazui was a familiar bunch of skyscrapers, with Shanghai Tower dominating above them all, and the Huangpu River the only mass of blackness, although dotted with the occasional lights of boats and ships.   </span></div>

                                    “I was talking to one of my friends yesterday, and he told me that he feels sorry for international students who have to celebrate their holidays alone, away from family and home. It reminds me of something that I think I’ve told you before – I really admire international students for what I believe takes a ton of bravery, to move to a strange new place far away from what is familiar and comfortable, to a place where the language and culture is often different, to a place that they’d often never set foot in before. I remember when I was about to start my first year of university, and I was moving literally 40 minutes away from my parents’ house, and I was already nervous and anxious, even though in all honesty I had no reason to be. My roommate in first year was an international student from Taiwan, and one night I asked her why she had chosen to study at UBC. She replied, "I want to broaden my horizons and challenge myself.” <br><br> Somehow it turned out that I would find myself in a peculiar sort of parallel situation, where instead of my moving halfway across the world away from my parents, they’d move halfway across the world away from me. People are always confused when I have to explain that I’m Canadian and I’ve grown up in Canada almost all my life, but my parents currently live in Shanghai. One of the questions I dislike the most on forms and applications is, “What is your permanent address?” because I never know what to write – do I write my UBC residence address, which is hardly permanent, or do I write the address of the home that I grew up in, which is now occupied by a family that I’ve never met, or do I write my parents’ address in Shanghai, which I’ve never lived in long-term?”

Looking back on it, it took them an incredible amount of courage – like they had a comfortable life in China, with a house in the city, well-paying jobs, family nearby, a familiar environment. To completely pack up and set off for a completely unfamiliar country on the other side of the world, where people speak a language foreign to them, and with a three-year-old child in tow… That’s incredible. Immigrant parents are incredible. ”

C’est vrai que les images de ces villes m’ont été toujours familières, depuis que j’ai commencé à rêver du voyage. Des grands places dont les bâtiments imposants témoignent des décennies, peut-être des centaines d’années d’histoire. Des rues et des boulevards dont les noms rappellent tant de cours d’histoire et de langues, des chansons et des romans et des films. Des plats locaux qui ne se trouvent pas chez moi. Des gens, les individus qui résident dans ces villes, que je n’aurais jamais rencontrés, dont les vies sont peut-être semblables à la mienne, ou peut-être complètement différentes. 
                                <br><br>
                                Le voyage, c’est la richesse. C’est l’occasion d’explorer, d’apprendre, de se sentir inspiré. Réinventé, peut-être. De se lancer dans l’inconnu, pourtant ce n'est peut-être pas la destination qu’on trouve à la fin, mais soi-même. De voir avec ses propres yeux à ce qui ressemble le monde, de se rendre compte qu'à quel point le monde est énorme, illimité. De se rendre compte, peut-être, qu'à quel point le voyageur est illimité.

                                Un— Je veux vraiment connaitre un nouveau coin du monde.

                                Si on m’a demandé ce que je savais sur la ville de Copenhague avant que je m'y sois rendue, je n’aurais pu dire que, « C’est la capitale du Danemark. » Mais après les quarante-huit heures que j’ai passé dans cette ville de taille moyenne, Copenhague est devenu beaucoup plus qu’une ville sur la carte du monde accroché au mur dans ma chambre. Je sais maintenant qu’on peut trouver, dans le halle ouest de Torvehallerne, un étal qui vend des smørrebrød qui coutent un peu chers mais qui sont toujours délicieux, un festin pour les yeux autant que pour les papilles. Je sais maintenant qu’à 22h45 dans les jardins de Tivoli commence un spectacle appelé Illuminations, pendant lequel l’eau, la fumée, la lumière et le feu éblouissent l’audience ravi qui se rassemblent à côté du lac. Je sais également qu’il faut s’y rendre au moins cinq minutes à l’avance pour garantir la vue la plus spectaculaire. Enfin, je sais que le magasin Illums Bolighus est sans doute l’un des magasins les plus beaux que j’aie vus dans ma vie, car le magasin n’était pas qu’un magasin, mais c’était un véritable oeuvre d’art.

                                « Ton voyage s’est bien passé ? » me demandera sûrement un ami qui s’attendra à une réponse de « Oui, mon voyage s’est bien passé. » Mais comment pourrais-je résumer des semaines ou bien des mois en une seule phrase ? Une réponse de « oui » ne signifie rien. Mon carnet de voyage sera rempli d’histoires et de photos, de petits moments magiques et de grandes leçons importantes. Le currywurst que j’ai savouré dans un parc berlinois à côté de la rivière pendant un après-midi ensoleillé, après presque une semaine de journées pluvieuses consécutives. Alexanderplatz à Berlin à 21h00, où j’ai regardé flâner et bavarder et rire tous les gens autour de moi pendant que la tour TV surgissait dans le ciel nocturne comme une lune artificielle. J’étais contente, à l’aise, calme. J’aimais l’atmosphère, l'énergie, la musique que jouait quelqu’un avec une guitare, les bruits d’une place pleine de vie. Les lumières de la tour TV, la fontaine. Les gens surtout. Les clients, les couples, les amis, les familles. Les voyageurs, peut-être, des voyageurs comme moi.

                                Pendant mon premier voyage en solo, dans le train à destination de Londres, je me suis trouvée à côté d’un passager britannique qui était en chemin pour rendre visite à sa famille. Nous nous sommes mis à converser et j’ai appris qu’il avait étudié à UCL il y a quelques décennies et que quelques membres de sa famille habitaient à Vancouver, dans un quartier à côté de celui-ci où j’avais grandi. Dans mon auberge de jeunesse à Copenhague, la femme qui dormait dans le lit au-dessous du mien travaillait à Chicago et avait étudié à Barcelone pendant ses études universitaires, et elle avait décidé de passer du temps au Danemark, aux Pays-Bas et en Belgique pour s’échapper de sa vie ordinaire pendant quelques semaines. Dans la croisière du Danemark en Allemagne à 1h00, j’ai appris que l’étudiant qui s’asseyait derrière moi avait grandi dans l’un de mes quartiers préférés à Shanghai, et qu’il souhaitait déménager à Montréal après ses études d'architecture. Je ne sais pas comment s’appelait ces gens, car ils m’ont raconté seulement leurs histoires, mais parfois ce sont les histoires et pas les noms qui restent dans la mémoire.

                                La photographie, c’est un art, malgré les foules de touristes qui s’attroupent devant des monuments pour prendre des photos identiques, avant de monter dans le bus touristique pour visiter le prochain monument. Une bonne photo ne montre pas qu’à quoi ressemble l’objet de la photo, mais elle montre la façon dont le photographe le perçoit. De plus, l’art a toujours fait une grande partie de ma vie. C’est pour cela que j’ai attendu pendant une trentaine de minutes devant la porte Brandenburg le moment parfait où le soleil couchant s’apparait entre les arches de la porte. C’est pour cela que j’ai grimpés les quatre cents marches jusqu’au sommet de l’église de Notre-Sauveur à Copenhague, afin de voir un vue spectaculaire sur toute la ville. C’est pour cela que j’adore les façades colorées de tous les bâtiments dans la capitale danoise, parce que je connais très peu de villes qui appartiennent aussi sûrement au monde des contes de fées.

                                C’est probablement vrai que l’idée de courir des dizaines de kilomètres dans des villes munies de transports publics de haute qualité est un peu folle. Mais je ne veux pas me rendre simplement d’une destination A jusqu’à une destination B, parce que les découvertes les plus mémorables se cachent souvent sur le chemin. Sur une rue dans un quartier de Berlin qui apparaissait assez banal sur la carte, j’ai trouvé par hasard la plus jolie libraire dans toute la ville, un petit magasin rempli de plantes en pot, de lumières brillantes et de chansons anglais pop qui vend des lithographies aussi créatives que l’apparence du magasin, et d’innombrables cafés et boulangeries dont les viennoiseries et les petits gâteaux m’ont fait oublier que je venais juste d’acheter mon déjeuner.

                                Dans l’autobus à destination de Prague, j’ai hâte de découvrir les surprises que la ville me révélera. Malgré le sommeil qui me manque, la lourdeur de mon sac à dos et l’épuisement qui se répand dans mon corps après avoir marché plus de quarante kilomètres pendant une seule journée, l’appel de voyage est toujours plus fort.

                                Last night in Prague, flight back to Edinburgh tomorrow. I’m back in the old town square, where I caught my first glance of Prague two days ago. 11pm, Friday night, the square is full of life. The cathedral looms in the darkness, the astronomical tower stands facing it.

                                An hour before midnight, and it’s still warm. I won’t be able to wear a t-shirt outside like this for another month. A slight breeze passes through the air. Cars in the distance, but people and conversation all around me. Couples, friends, families, tourists welding large, bulky cameras. Children with ice cream, authentic Italian gelato, according to the hand-painted wooden sign dangling from one of the street stalls.

                                Prague is a fairytale city, they say. Magical. Charmingly winding streets. Dreamy bridges over the river. Large swathes of green space. An old town that has been immortalized in postcards, photos, paintings. 
                                <br><br>
                                I stand up to leave; I can’t stay too long tonight. Thanks for everything, Prague, thanks for being magical.

                                Noon. Burning summer heat, even if it’s just a fine spring day. I should enjoy this summer weather, given that it’s going to be cold and rainy when I return to Edinburgh. A long market, full of stalls. Mostly souvenirs, but a couple of them sell food too. One of them sells poppy seed and apple strudel. I picked poppy seed.
                                <br><br>
                                It reminds me of the poppy seed cake from LING327, the one Neda baked for us at the end of the term. Stuffed with poppy seeds and a sugary paste, powdered sugar dusted on top.

                                A man in a blue t-shirt sits down on the bench next to me. He’s bought poppy seed strudel from the same vendor. Smiles at me, says something in Czech, points to the cake. Perhaps he’s commenting on how I’m eating my strudel with a plastic fork — a weird Chinese habit, i suppose. 
                                <br><br>
                                We eat together on the beach in silence, enjoying the sunshine. He finishes his in three large bites, stands up, continues to walk down the street.
