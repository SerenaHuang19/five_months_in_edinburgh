# Five Months in Edinburgh

I went on exchange to the University of Edinburgh from January 10th to June 1st, 2018. During these five months, I kept a journal of my daily experiences and adventures, which I later produced as a book. [This website](https://serenahuang19.github.io) aims to share the content of the book in an interactive and hopefully interesting way. I hope you enjoy!

All photographs and text are mine and taken directly from the original book. 

For each day of my exchange, there is a photograph (not necessarily taken that day, but taken in that month), as well as a wordcloud representing the 25 words with the highest [tf-idf scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) from that day, and finally a sentence pulled from that day's journal entry containing one or more of the words from that wordcloud. The code used to generate the tf-idf scores can be found [here](https://github.com/SerenaHuang19/text_analyses/blob/master/five_months_in_edinburgh_raw.ipynb).

In the Extras section, 'Overheard on Exchange' features out-of-context quotes pulled from the text using regex, while 'A Sprinkle of Starlight' collects miscellaneous text pieces that can also be found on my writing and poetry blog, [A Sprinkle of Starlight](https://asprinkleofstarlight.tumblr.com/).
